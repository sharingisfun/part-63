V. Iyer is based on the true story of the life of Adi Shankaracharya, one of India\\'s greatest thinkers, who lived during the 8th century. Shankara is born into a wealthy Brahmin family and leads a happy and privileged childhood. That is, until, his father dies while he\\'s still young. This death kindles his desire for learning and his quest of knowledge. Having come of age, Shankara convinces his mother to let him lead a monastic life. After wandering in search of enlightenment, he studies with the famed seer Govinda, who charges him with writing a new commentary on the Vedic texts. While writing the commentary, Shankara has a moment of enlightenment. He journeys into the Himalayas, where he establishes a school and lives out the rest of his days. A beautifully shot film that makes the most of the Indian countryside -- it won the Indian equivalent of an Oscar for Best Film of 1983.
