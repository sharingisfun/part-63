Features like refactoring, code generation, code\nassist and semantic analysis combine to enable rapid application\ndevelopment on both the server side (in PHP) and the browser side\n(in JavaScript). Zend Studio also makes it simple to develop in a\nproduction-like environment by integrating with VMware Workstation for\nrunning and debugging PHP applications.\n\nZend Studio provides comprehensive debugging and testing support that\nhelps you analyze and resolve problems quickly. Through support for both\nlocal and remote (on server) debugging, integrated PHP and JavaScript\ndebugging, profiling, code inspection &amp; quick fix, test generation &amp;\nreporting, you have the tools you need to diagnose and resolve application\nproblems quickly while ensuring your code starts out correctly.  Tight\nintegration with Zend Server speeds root cause analysis of problems\ndetected in testing, staging or the production environment.\n\nZend Studio was designed with cloud development in mind. It allows you to\ncode using the Zend Developer Cloud on phpcloud.com as your development\nruntime - now you can use an instantly available, consistent PHP\nenvironment that delivers superior debugging, increased productivity and\ncollaboration in the cloud. It's also easier than ever to deploy PHP\napplications into any of several supported clouds.\n\nAnd if you work with Amazon Web Services, you'll find it easier than ever\nto leverage services like EC2, S3, and others using the AWS toolkit built\ninto Zend Studio 9.\n\nZend Studio enhances productivity with team-oriented development features,\nsuch as support for source configuration management (Git, GitHub, CVS,\nSVN) and shared project settings. These features help improve\ncollaboration between project members.\n\nEnjoy another fine release from HERiTAGE!\n\nINSTALL NOTES:\n\n1. Unpack the archive in your location of choice.\n2.
