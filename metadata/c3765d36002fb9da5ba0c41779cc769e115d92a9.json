It begins with the 1964 single, Liza Jane/Louie, Louie Go Home recorded by Davie Jones with the King Bees on the Vocalion Pop label. It concludes with the single, I Dig Everything/Im Not Losing Sleep recorded by David Bowie on Pye Records.  In between are 13 additional tracks including The Manish Boys single, I Pity the Fool/Take My Tip on Parlophone.  It also includes other Pye Records material recorded with the Lower Third. This collection basically encapsulates everything Bowie recorded prior to his moving to Deram Records and his subsequent debut album, David Bowie. If you have this and the David Bowie (Deluxe Edition) release from 2010, you probably have the entire Bowie catalog covered prior to Man of Words/Man of Music aka Space Oddity.\n\n\n\nReview from Allmusic.com\n\nby Richie Unterberger\n\nBefore landing his first commercial success with 1969s Space Oddity, David Bowie released a number of flop records in a variety of styles. He first emerged in the mid-1960s as a mod following the paths of The Who, Kinks, and Rolling Stones. The 17-cut CD Early On (1964-66) is by far the most comprehensive anthology of his first works, gathering all six of his first singles and adding five previously unreleased demos from 1965. Fans of Bowies famous work may be nonplussed by this material, in which the singer shifts from sub-Stones R&amp;B to Who/Kinkish power chords to trendy Swinging London pop in search of his own style. He didnt establish his own identity on these fairly derivative recordings, but thats not to say they arent without their enjoyable aspects. The 1965 single Youve Got A Habit Of Leaving has some fierce Who-styled feedback, Cant Help Thinking About Me is an uneasily introspective number that foreshadows his later lyrics, and the acoustic demos find him groping closer toward a more familiar and distinctive vocal style. Several of the tunes on this collection were produced by the legendary Shel Talmy, who also handled sessions for The Who and Kinks in the mid sixties.\n\nRipped using EAC from a brand new, never played, original Rhino CD.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3765d36002fb9da5ba0c41779cc769e115d92a9","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+-+Early+On+%281964-1966%29+Rhino+1991+%5BEAC%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3765d36002fb9da5ba0c41779cc769e115d92a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,118,93,54,0,47,185,218,91,160,196,23,121,204,118,158,17,93,146,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
