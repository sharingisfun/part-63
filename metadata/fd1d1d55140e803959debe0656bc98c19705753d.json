It is a sequel to the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes, based on the character of the same name created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The screenplay is written by Kieran Mulroney and Michele Mulroney. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively, as the duo join forces to outwit and bring down their most cunning adversary, Professor Moriarty, played by Jared Harris. The film is specifically influenced by Conan Doyle's work The Final Problem, but it is an independent story rather than a strict adaptation.\n\n\n* Plot :\n\nIn 1891, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) delivers a package to Dr. HoffmanstahlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½payment for a letter he was to deliver. Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a hidden bomb which is prevented from detonating by the intervention of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.). Holmes takes the letter and disposes of the bomb while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. Holmes later finds Hoffmanstahl assassinated. Adler meets with Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) to explain the events, but Moriarty poisons her with fast-acting tuberculosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½deeming her position compromised by her love for Holmes.\n\nSome time later, Dr. Watson (Jude Law) arrives at 221B Baker Street, where Holmes discloses that he is investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks, and business acquisitions, that he has connected to Moriarty. Holmes meets with the gypsy Simza (Noomi Rapace), the intended recipient of the letter he had taken from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can interrogate her. After Watson and Mary's (Kelly Reilly) wedding, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Moriarty informs Holmes that he murdered Adler and will kill Watson and Mary if Holmes' interference continues.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2011 *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd1d1d55140e803959debe0656bc98c19705753d","amp;dn":"SHERLOCK+HOLMES+-+A+GAME+OF+SHADOWS+RMVB+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd1d1d55140e803959debe0656bc98c19705753d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,29,29,85,20,14,128,57,89,222,190,6,86,188,152,193,151,5,117,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
