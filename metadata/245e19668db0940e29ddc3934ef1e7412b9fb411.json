Oz Clarke is dispatched in a small plane armed with a salt shaker to see if cloud seeding really will produce the desired effect.\n\nBack in the Man Lab, James invents a Christmas tree decorating blunderbuss, he discovers the easiest way to wrap presents and he attempts to transform the tired Christmas cracker by making his own - with shocking results.
