Lewis moved into the record business during the mid-'60s, signing raw artists who made music light-years away from slick pop fare. This two-disc anthology features prime Jewel and Paula acts from the 1960s, '70s and '80s. The first disc includes urgent soul tunes from Toussaint McCall and Ted Taylor, Delta blues from Frank Foster, classic shouting R&amp;B from Joe Turner, the smoother R&amp;B sound of Charles Brown, Lightnin' Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, and others. The second disc is just as distinguished, featuring Little Johnny Taylor, Fontella Bass, Ike and Tina Turner, Buster Benton and Ted Taylor, then-budding stars Bobby Rush and Artie &quot;Blues Boy&quot; White, plus other regional attractions.\n\ncd's ripped by EAC \n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92a28e02c54955db091c240d082ed3a3e959484","amp;dn":"Jewel-Paula+Records+Story...2cd%5C%27s%281993%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92a28e02c54955db091c240d082ed3a3e959484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,42,40,224,44,84,149,93,176,145,194,64,208,130,237,58,62,149,148,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
