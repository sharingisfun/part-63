Their 800 kilometer trek was punctuated by underwater dives, scientific measurements and -30Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°c blizzards! The Arctic is a little known part of the world, but what is under the ice cap is even more of a secret to us.\n\n\nDeep Sea Under the Pole is a revolutionary pioneering expedition and an innovative human adventure that combines ski trekking and scuba diving in one of the toughest climates on the planet.\n\n\nThis crew of eight young passionate divers, adventurers and explorers  in celebration of a century of conquest of the North Pole represent the first time man will cover such a long distance, over 800km, while also executing dives at remote sites that reveal the hidden side of the polar ice cap; something never before seen by humankind.\n\n\nThe focus of the expedition is to commemorate the hidden and difficult-to-access underside of the polar ice cap, a spectacular World Heritage Site that is now disappearing due to climate change.\nThis vast upside-down universe is home to huge icy ceilings above and a seemingly invisible bottom below, rich with other mysteries. It is a universe of water and ice - a world of polar white, deep black, emerald green and clear turquoise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: Thierry Robert\n===========================\n\n\nProduced by: Sylvie Barbe &amp; Jean-Marc Robert\n============================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Deepsea Under The Pole\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:44:54\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2718 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    873 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2010\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53a1c70c3c94f1edb27427d7908bdbf02026d98e","amp;dn":"Deepsea+Under+The+Pole-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53a1c70c3c94f1edb27427d7908bdbf02026d98e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,161,199,12,60,148,241,237,178,116,39,215,144,139,219,240,32,38,217,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
