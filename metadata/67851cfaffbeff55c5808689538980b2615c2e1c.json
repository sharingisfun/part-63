Luckily, she washes up on the shores of an abandoned island. While searching the island, she stumbles upon the reason the island is abandoned. A military biotech experiment went awry, infecting the island with bizarre creatures seemingly fused from nature and technology. Now, the 'experiment' threatens to spread into the ocean.\n\nDarienne assembles a team of crack scientists and inventors for a return to Xeno Island to search for clues and a way to end the threat. As part of that team, you'll need your gaming skills and brainpower to crack the codes protecting the virus and its origins.\n\nIn Missions 1--5, you and the team land on the island and try to decipher the mysteries found around every corner. You must break the code to bypass a security system and access the Research and Development Facility. Using math skills that grow as you investigate the island, you'll check energy readings, crack codes, strap on a jet pack, and fly through the trees.\n\nDarienne and her team need to stay focused.

Unlike other learning programs, Evolver applies the latest in 3D video gaming technology to create an immersive, entertaining, program that covers standards-based high impact educational objectives as defined by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). By completing missions in a virtual education gaming environment, kids learn pre-algebra concepts they need to succeed in school. Delivered in a stunning first person, action adventure video game format, kids are impressed with the graphics and action, parents and teachers are impressed with the skills it teaches. What teachers are saying. &quot;The biggest problem we have with the program is that students donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿t want to stop playing  our summer school students wanted to keep going!Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ Dr. Jim Wohlgehagen, Secondary Mathematics Coordinator, Plano Independent School District President, Texas Assn. of Supervisors of Mathematics (TASM). _____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDimension X: Evolver Pre-Algebra is a game that definitely deserves a look. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s designed to have the feel of a first person shooter and an RPG in one. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s storyline and graphics will hold a studentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attention, while the math is incorporated into the game in a subtle puzzle solving nature. The game begins with us choosing a character to sign up for a mission to save a scientist on an island. Each character has a full background story that makes them seem real.\n\nThen a small training is given to allow players to become accustomed to the game settings. This section even provides practice in the quiz that follows each stage of the game. The answers are shown to be correct or incorrect. If incorrect, a voice will tell the player that there is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œerror in the data.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This could be improved by providing explanations for why the answer was wrong but the instantaneous feedback is nonetheless helpful to the playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s learning.\n\nLearning does not just take place in the quizzes in this game. Players collect numbers to break codes in the technology of the antagonistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lab in order to open gates and gain entry to their bases. Players also fight with creatures and others in the game using numbers and equipment such as EMPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to do damage to enemies.\n\nWith great visuals, a good story line, math application and quizzes, I would recommend this game to any student of pre-algebra. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67851cfaffbeff55c5808689538980b2615c2e1c","amp;dn":"DimensionM+Evolver+Pre-Algebra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67851cfaffbeff55c5808689538980b2615c2e1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,133,28,250,255,190,255,85,197,128,134,137,83,137,128,178,97,92,46,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
