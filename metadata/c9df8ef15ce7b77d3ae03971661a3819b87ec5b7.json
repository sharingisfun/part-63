Support more than two profiles\n- (NEW!) CPU history display\n- overvolting support (+50mV and 1500mV limit) \n- undervolting up to -250mV (lite version limited to -200mV)\n\nAfter you install the key Extreme features will be unlocked.\nConsider it rather *donate version* because these features are NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK.\n\nUSE THIS APPLICATION ON YOUR OWN RISK\n\nI recommend app nitrality, which I develop with insanity ROM maker nitr8!\nSimilar CPU speed setting apps: SetCPU, OverclockWidget, PimpMyCPU, CPU Tuner, Milestone Overclock, CPU Master, No-frills CPU Control\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\n+ pre Gingerbread fix incoming!\n+ boot settings can be applied by service - this means better, safer and more realiable.\n+ *lots* of bugfixes for some strange devices I've never heard about\nI need to fix translations, but this will take some time.\n\n\nEnjoy and Please Seed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9df8ef15ce7b77d3ae03971661a3819b87ec5b7","amp;dn":"Voltage+Control+Extreme+Full+v4.9.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9df8ef15ce7b77d3ae03971661a3819b87ec5b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,223,142,241,92,231,183,125,58,224,57,113,102,26,56,25,184,126,197,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
