Kelly (Clint Eastwood), a former lieutenant who has been demoted to private as a scapegoat following a disastrous assault some time earlier, captures Colonel Dankhopf of German Intelligence. When Kelly notices his prisoner has a gold bar in his briefcase, he gets him drunk to try to get information about the gold. Before he is killed by an attacking German Tiger tank, the drunken Dankhopf blurts out that there is a cache of 14,000 gold bars (worth $16 million) stored in a bank vault 30 miles behind enemy lines in the town of Clermont (most likely Clermont-en-Argonne).\n\n::GENERAL::\n\nComplete name: Kelly's Heros 1970 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 2515.76 MiB\nDuration: 2h 29mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 350 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2012-01-04 22:13:12\nSubtitles: English,Greek,Norwegian,Romanian,Swedish\nEncoded by Vice\n\n::VIDEO SPECIFICATION::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 116 r2074 2641b9e\nAverage video bitrate: 2000\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1\nResolution: 1280x528\nSource: Blu-ray Thanks\n\n::AUDIO SPECIFICATION::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nChannel positions Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/78784834573677529545.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/78784834573677529545.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/16698721423070372400.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/16698721423070372400.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/51308299013236069812.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/51308299013236069812.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/59902658107076875655.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/59902658107076875655.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n::Info Hash:: 5BB1EA8D9E7096BA007F027AE8EE9C2D5082336C\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb1ea8d9e7096ba007f027ae8ee9c2d5082336c","amp;dn":"Kelly%5C%27s+Heros+1970+720p+BRRip+x264+vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb1ea8d9e7096ba007f027ae8ee9c2d5082336c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,177,234,141,158,112,150,186,0,127,2,122,232,238,156,45,80,130,51,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
