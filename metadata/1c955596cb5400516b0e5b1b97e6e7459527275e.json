It includes the &quot;4th Hour&quot; with Pat &amp; Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).\n\nSorry for the delay in posting - Friday had Joe Pags filling in for Glenn. I 'll be out of the country until January 4th, so there may be delays in posting until I get back, but every day will go up (eventually).\n\nI had some trouble uploading these two days to TPB, but I had posted to kickass and demonoid.  I always cross post to both of those sites, so if you're desperate, you can find them.\n\nRESIST WE MUCH!
