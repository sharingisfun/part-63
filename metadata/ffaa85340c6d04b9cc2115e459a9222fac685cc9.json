Yet far from being the invincible holy warriors of legend, Dr Asbridge reveals that these crusaders actually considered surrender in the midst of their titanic expedition.\n\nource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVCodec: XviD (2 pass MPEG)\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 720*400\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffaa85340c6d04b9cc2115e459a9222fac685cc9","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Crusades+1.+Holy+war+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffaa85340c6d04b9cc2115e459a9222fac685cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,170,133,52,12,109,4,185,204,33,21,228,89,169,34,47,172,104,92,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
