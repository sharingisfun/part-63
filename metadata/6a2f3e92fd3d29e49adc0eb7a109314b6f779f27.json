But as he gets closer to actually jumping into the water, he starts to worry.He has always loved Shark Week.But when he gets the chance to get off the couch and be in the show, he gets in way over his head. Discovery wants him to go to the Bahamas to swim with, touch and if he has the guts feed sharks.\n\n\nFerguson starts to have second thoughts about getting close to the apex predators of the sea.Especially since he will not have the protection of a cage. Everything Ferguson sees and experiences reminds him of what he has learned from watching the Discovery Channel. \n\n\nWoven into FergusonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journey are clips from the scariest, most exciting moments of the last 20 years of Shark Week. The results are funny, scary, and ultimately very moving. Terrified of getting in the water and too proud not to, Ferguson makes the leap into an ocean full of hungry sharks.He's in for a surprise when he finally gets underwater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosted by: Craig Ferguson\n=========================\n\n\nDirected &amp; Written by: Rick King\n================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Shark Bites Adventures In Shark Week\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:42:51\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2502 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    767 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    4 August 2010\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754485/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754485/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a2f3e92fd3d29e49adc0eb7a109314b6f779f27","amp;dn":"Shark+Bites+Adventures+In+Shark+Week-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a2f3e92fd3d29e49adc0eb7a109314b6f779f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,47,62,146,253,61,41,228,154,220,14,183,161,9,49,75,111,119,159,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
