The truth of the inspired Scriptures are preached and taught in all of our services. Our preacher James Liston Goude speaks the true Gospel of Jesus Christ our Savior at every Sunday morning service. He is a retired minister who preached for many years at several Church of God churches. He found salvation at Paran Baptist Church in 1949.\n\nWe have been studying the New Testament on Sunday night since 2004. On Wednesday nights we have special prayer service and outreach. We also have a Bible Quiz Service once a month. Also once a month we have teaching on Bible Prophecy and the Awakening Church.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.paranbaptistchurch.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.paranbaptistchurch.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e6e39446cd2a1dd0711b0bf1a65a9a333204ed9","amp;dn":"Paran+Baptist+Church+in+Lake+City%2C+SC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e6e39446cd2a1dd0711b0bf1a65a9a333204ed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,110,57,68,108,210,161,221,7,17,176,191,26,101,169,163,51,32,78,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
