You have a businessman that you must assassinate BUT you donâ€™t want to just aim the missile directly at him â€“ you have to cause an explosion that will propel rubble towards your target and kill him indirectly. The more buildings you destroy before you kill the businessman, the more points youâ€™ll be awarded â€“ so the art lies in targeting the explosion as far away as possible whilst still having a chance of killing your target.\r\n\r\nNuclear Business is a simple game jam prototype at the moment, but hopefully Landfall Games will continue to work on it as itâ€™s core gameplay is great fun. A strangely addictive bit of low poly rubble-propelling assassination (and blowing sh*t up is always fun!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd51df0687b9fb0a580d9554d3630373a92de6d5","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Business+Game+Jam+Build+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd51df0687b9fb0a580d9554d3630373a92de6d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,81,223,6,135,185,251,10,88,13,149,84,211,99,3,115,169,45,230,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
