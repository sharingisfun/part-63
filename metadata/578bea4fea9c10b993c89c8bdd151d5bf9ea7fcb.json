Pic-a-POD 2 is a complete re-write of this app and is now available in the Mac App Store for US 99 cents. It allows access to 8 different POD sites and you can get the PODs for any date back to 1st January 2009.\n\nA picture browser allows easy access to all your downloaded PODs, while a detailed view shows a larger image and more text information. View the pic on it's original web site, or share the link using email, Facebook, Twitter or Google+. If you set Pic-a-POD to change to a random desktop at intervals, you can also set it to include a picture from your iPhoto library occasionally. Pic-a-POD also allows for multiple monitors and multiple workspaces in Mission Control.\n\nWhat's New:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨* The Pic-a-POD window will now fill with pics, going back in time if\n  required.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* To adjust the number of pics shown, change the size of the window.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* This is particularly useful if you like to get only one or two pics per day or if you have a large monitor.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* Stopped occasional crash when setting desktop.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* No longer gets data for unwanted sources.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* Google+ button now enabled &amp; disabled correctly.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* Reduced memory usage.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* Mouse scroll wheel now works correctly.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* Fixed minor update &amp; date display issues.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.6 or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:578bea4fea9c10b993c89c8bdd151d5bf9ea7fcb","amp;dn":"Pic-a-POD+v.+2.0.1+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"578bea4fea9c10b993c89c8bdd151d5bf9ea7fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,139,234,79,234,156,16,185,147,200,156,139,221,21,29,91,249,234,127,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
