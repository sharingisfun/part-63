When Lord Raiden, God of Thunder and protector of Earth, finds himself in an earthly mental institution in the year 2011, his 'delusions' are treated with some rather primitive forms of therapy (involving an ECT machine and an ice pick). Nonetheless, Blue, his beautiful, fragile yet insane fellow inmate, is Raiden's only hope of escaping the mental hospital and making his way to the Mortal Kombat tournament to defend Earthrealm from Shao Khan.
