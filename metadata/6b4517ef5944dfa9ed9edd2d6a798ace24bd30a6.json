REBECCA MADSEN (Sarah Jones) is assigned to a grisly homicide case, a fingerprint leads her to a seemingly impossible suspect: JACK SYLVANE (guest star Jeffrey Pierce), an Alcatraz inmate who died over 30 years ago. Given her family history ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ both her grandfather and surrogate uncle, RAY ARCHER (Robert Forster), were guards at the prison ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ MadsenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interest is immediately piqued. When the enigmatic, knows-everything-but-tells-nothing government agent EMERSON HAUSER (Sam Neill) tries to impede her investigation, she becomes doggedly committed to it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b4517ef5944dfa9ed9edd2d6a798ace24bd30a6","amp;dn":"Alcatraz.S01E03.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b4517ef5944dfa9ed9edd2d6a798ace24bd30a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,69,23,239,89,68,223,169,237,158,221,45,106,121,138,206,36,189,48,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
