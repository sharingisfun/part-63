It was carefully remastered using High Quality Hard- and Software. There's no clipping, no shitty expanders, no brainless EQ distortion. Just pure, powerful, carefully remastered, metal-music. As we know, the original Release lacked in Power and dynamics - I tried hardly to improve your listening experience.\r\n\r\nI'm an audiophile High-End HiFi Enthusiast, who tries to make good, old, classic Metal music sound more &quot;real&quot;, &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot;, without using shitty EQ or any sort of cheap Compressors. \r\n\r\nCompression is cancer, so I tried to improve the songs step by step. Of course, there is no clipping.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and give me some Feedback if you guys want more audiophile remasters.\r\n\r\nSource: CD, slowly ripped with NAIM UnitiServe. NAIM DAC. NAIM Amps. Xavian Speakers. Carbon Cables from Audioquest. Clean, filtered AC.\r\n\r\nAIFF, 16 Bit, 1411 kBit/s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun and kick ass!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0dff2af6faa023056dd9df2a5a9a906c98b97a9","amp;dn":"Virgin+Steele+-+Visions+Of+Eden+Remastered+-+Audiophile+Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0dff2af6faa023056dd9df2a5a9a906c98b97a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,223,242,175,111,170,2,48,86,221,157,242,165,169,169,6,201,139,151,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
