This region came to be known as the &quot;Lost Ground&quot;. Over the years, some of the citizens managed to erect a new city in a corner of the Lost Ground and surrounded it with a barrier to protect it from the impoverished inhabitants of the island's surrounding wasteland. However, another phenomenon began to show up in the Lost Ground: Alter, the ability to rearrange matter at the atomic level in certain ways. &quot;Inners&quot; who were born with Alter powers became known as Alter Users, and Alter Users who lived outside the city and misused their powers were branded &quot;Natives&quot;. The police force known as HOLD was constructed to control Native Alter Users. A division of it called HOLY was later created and made up almost entirely of law-abiding Alter Users.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a193420887eff015b94f00269ea332a544bd1f6","amp;dn":"S-Cry-Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a193420887eff015b94f00269ea332a544bd1f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,25,52,32,136,126,255,1,91,148,240,2,105,234,51,42,84,75,209,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
