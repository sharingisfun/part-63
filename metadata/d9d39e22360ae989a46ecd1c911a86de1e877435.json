Cross's adaptation delves into themes of ageing, hubris and the supernatural, with a horrifying psychological twist in the tale.\n\nJames Parkin has just left his wife in the care of a nursing home. Pensive and emotional, he travels to their old favourite destination for rambling, an off-season British seaside town. There he encounters an apparition on a desolate beach, which begins to haunt him - with terrifying consequences.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1795050/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1795050/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nI have a slow connection so please be patient, you will get your file\n\nThanks\n\nAnonymous","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9d39e22360ae989a46ecd1c911a86de1e877435","amp;dn":"Whistle+And+I%5C%27ll++You+-+2010+-+BBC+John+Hurt.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9d39e22360ae989a46ecd1c911a86de1e877435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,211,158,34,54,10,233,137,164,110,205,28,145,26,134,222,30,135,116,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
