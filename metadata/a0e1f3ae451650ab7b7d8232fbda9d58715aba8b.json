Still can't get it to ask which files before it loads to Bittorrent. I'll get there. \n\nI ran this file and it set up the old Bittorent over the new one. Didn't lose anything.\n\ncheers\nKim ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0e1f3ae451650ab7b7d8232fbda9d58715aba8b","amp;dn":"Bittorrent+6.1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0e1f3ae451650ab7b7d8232fbda9d58715aba8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,225,243,174,69,22,80,171,123,125,130,50,251,218,157,88,113,90,186,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
