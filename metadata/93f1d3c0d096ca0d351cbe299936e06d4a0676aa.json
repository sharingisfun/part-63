It is so called a Tasmanian Tiger because of the stripes on its back.\n\nAn end title card reads: &quot;Traps and snares are illegal in Tasmania&quot;. \n\nWillem Dafoe had to deal with leeches during production filming in the Tasmanian wilderness in Australia. In a media interview, he joked how he didn't lose any blood, ironic because his previous Australian film Daybreakers had been a vampire movie. Both movies co-star Sam Neill.\n\nThe film's source novelist Julia Leigh is also a writer-director herself, writing and directing Sleeping Beauty, another Australian movie released in the same year as this film. Leigh however did not actually work on the screenplay nor direct this film. \n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nThe Hunter 2011 720p BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr\n\n\n\nvideo details\n\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
