Rare achieve footage of never release for public viewing films, some scenes breath taking - seeing our war machines in action, others horrific (should not have been shown on network television) showing mangle smash, burn and shot up human bodies Allies and Axis (see Benito Mussolini body and you know what I mean). There's a great behind the scene segment on director John Ford staging his 1942 production of the attack on Pearl Harbor, model ships and planes enter cut with the real footage of that day. Hank walks and narrates through a photo gallery (wearing a long beard-film during the production of `Cast Away') points out the significance of each photo and how all but one reel of the D-Day invasion was lost at sea. Stephen Ambrose narrates the second half of the show at the Normandy grave site. The conclusion have our camera men in Japan showing you in living color the full effects of the Atomic bombs. \n\n     |                       |               \n,---.|---.,---.,---.,---.,---|.   .,-.-.,---.\n`---.|   |,---||    |---'|   ||   || | ||   |\n`---'`   '`---^`    `---'`---'`---'` ' '|---'.org\nMusic,Appz,Xbox360,Tv,Movies,Ps3,Games..|     \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d89471c4aedd418bf0579697d0e4dd6c5e797ab","amp;dn":"Shooting.War.2000.SWESUB.DVDRip.DOCU.x264.AC3-snuttebullen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d89471c4aedd418bf0579697d0e4dd6c5e797ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,137,71,28,74,237,212,24,191,5,121,105,125,14,77,214,197,231,151,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
