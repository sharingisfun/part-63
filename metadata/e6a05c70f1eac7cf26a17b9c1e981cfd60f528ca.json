Cross's adaptation delves into themes of ageing, hubris and the supernatural, with a horrifying psychological twist in the tale.\n\nJames Parkin has just left his wife in the care of a nursing home. Pensive and emotional, he travels to their old favourite destination for rambling, an off-season British seaside town. There he encounters an apparition on a desolate beach, which begins to haunt him - with terrifying consequences.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\nCropped bars\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:2.35 (1280*540)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC in TS\nAudio: AC3 2ch 192Kbps in TS\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1920*1080i to 1280*540p\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6a05c70f1eac7cf26a17b9c1e981cfd60f528ca","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Whistle+and+I%5C%27ll++You+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6a05c70f1eac7cf26a17b9c1e981cfd60f528ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,160,92,112,241,234,199,207,38,161,123,156,30,152,28,253,96,245,40,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
