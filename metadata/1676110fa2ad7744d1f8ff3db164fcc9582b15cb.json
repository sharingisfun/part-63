A recovering alcoholic and bulimic, Glennon found that rock\r\nbottom was a familiar place. In the midst of crisis, she knew to hold on to what she discovered in\r\nrecovery: that her deepest pain has always held within it an invitation to a richer life.\r\nLove Warrior is the story of one marriage, but it is also the story of the healing that is possible for\r\nany of us when we refuse to settle for good enough and begin to face pain and love head-on. This\r\nastonishing memoir reveals how our ideals of masculinity and femininity can make it impossible for a\r\nman and a woman to truly know one another - and it captures the beauty that unfolds when one\r\ncouple commits to unlearning everything they've been taught so that they can finally, after thirteen\r\nyears of marriage, commit to living trueâ€•true to themselves and to each other.\r\nLove Warrior is a gorgeous and inspiring account of how we are born to be warriors: strong,\r\npowerful, and brave; able to confront the pain and claim the love that exists for us all. This chronicle\r\nof a beautiful, brutal journey speaks to anyone who yearns for deeper, truer relationships and a more\r\nabundant, authentic life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1676110fa2ad7744d1f8ff3db164fcc9582b15cb","amp;dn":"Love+Warrior+%28Oprah%27s+Boo%29+A+Memoir%2C+by+Glennon+Doyle+Melton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1676110fa2ad7744d1f8ff3db164fcc9582b15cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,118,17,15,162,173,119,68,209,248,255,61,177,100,252,201,88,43,21,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
