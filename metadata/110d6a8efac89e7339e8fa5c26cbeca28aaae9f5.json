However, the United States Marine Corps are humanity's last line of defense, and as such they are armed to the teeth with the very latest in high explosive and automatic weaponry. \r\nAs the Predator, you will stalk from the shadows and from above, passing athletically through the treetops to ambush your victims. Although equipped with an array of powerful, exotic weapons and tracking equipment, honor ultimately dictates that you must get in close and take your trophies face to face. \r\nAs the most deadly species in the universe, the Alien offers you the chance to play as the very stuff of nightmares - the monster in the dark swarming forward with countless others, jaws like a steel trap and claws like blades. \r\nPlay all sides off against each other in a series of unique 3-way online modes and go tooth-to-claw-to-pulse rifle in the reinvention of one of multiplayer gaming's defining moments. \r\n\r\nRepack Features:\r\n\r\nBased on Aliens.vs.Predator.MULTi8-PROPHET ISO release: ppt-avpz.iso (19,598,139,392 bytes) \r\nBoth DLCs (Swarm Map Pack &amp; Bughunt Map Pack) included and activated (available in MP/SP Survival only) \r\n100% Lossless &amp; MD5 Perfect: all files are identical to originals after installation \r\nAlternative UberPsyX SteamFix included, allows multiplayer between the same crack users.
