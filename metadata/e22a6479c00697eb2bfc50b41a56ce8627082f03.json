This forty day adventure proves tougher than any of them ever thought possible, as the money dries up the teams are forced to push themselves harder than ever before in the struggle not only to survive but to make it to the final.Art of Survival is the definitive arts hustle and the ultimate answer to the age old question: what is art really worth?\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nFour artists, including 2 cellists, an opera singer and an award-winning portrait painter have been dropped in Athens, Greece with no money, no credit cards and only their talent to get them back home for a prestigious appearance at the Edinburgh Festival. Singer Lindsey Crow and cellist Li Lu take on artist Johan Andersson and cellist Janie Price in a race from Athens to Edinburgh, financed only by the cash they make from their own art\n\n2)  Part 2 \nWith empty pockets, Janie and Johan take a big risk when they take a detour to Capri. Meanwhile, an undercover police officer puts an end to Li Lu and Lindsey's moneymaking in Rome.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nWith just ten euros, Lindsey and Li Lu take a huge gamble when they check into a 250-euro-a-night hotel in Venice. Meanwhile, Janie battles for a slot on a Florence radio station.\n\n4)  Part 4 \nWhile Janie and Johan are forced to sleep on the streets in Zurich, back in Italy, Li Lu and Lindsey make a 4,500 pound trade that changes the entire course of the competition. Johan and Janie take a trip to the Basel's prestigious Laleh June Galerie to see if Johan can sell them a painting.\n\n5)  Part 5 \nWith ten days to go, just 143 pounds separate the two teams. Cellist Li Lu and soprano Lindsey busk in Paris, while artist Johan and singer Janie hope to strike it rich in Dusseldorf. The girls have run out of money and are weighing up their options.\n\n6)  Part 6 \nAfter five weeks of haggling, hustling, bartering and begging, the two teams finally reach Edinburgh and discover their final art trade totals, before the winners are revealed.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/5521/artofsurvivalscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/5521/artofsurvivalscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/3834/artofsurvivalscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/3834/artofsurvivalscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5319/artofsurvivalscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5319/artofsurvivalscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img851.imageshack.us/img851/8473/artofsurvivalscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img851.imageshack.us/img851/8473/artofsurvivalscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/5725/artofsurvivalscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/5725/artofsurvivalscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/1401/artofsurvivalscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/1401/artofsurvivalscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4150/artofsurvivalscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4150/artofsurvivalscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/4360/artofsurvivalscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/4360/artofsurvivalscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/3377/artofsurvivalscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/3377/artofsurvivalscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC\n * Video Bitrate: 1746 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\n * Video Resolution: 832x464 (16.9)\n * Audio Codec: AC3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25FPS\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 700 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.skyarts.co.uk/art-design/article/the-art-of-survival/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.skyarts.co.uk/art-design/article/the-art-of-survival/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=How%20Art%20Made%20the%20World&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=How%20Art%20Made%20the%20World&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Power%20of%20Art&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Power%20of%20Art&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Art%20of%20Travel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Art%20of%20Travel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n3)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Art_of_Survival&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Art_of_Survival&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e22a6479c00697eb2bfc50b41a56ce8627082f03","amp;dn":"BSkyB+Art+of+Survival+3of6+PDTV+x264+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e22a6479c00697eb2bfc50b41a56ce8627082f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,42,100,121,192,6,151,235,43,252,80,180,26,86,206,134,39,8,47,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
