He's been on his own long enough to know how \n    to work  people and situations.  He finds that the father  who threw \n    him out as a teenager has died. He's left him an antique convertible \n    and something more important, a previously unknown brother, Raymond. \n    Raymond is autistic,  but has the ability  to calculate  complicated \n    mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy.     \n      Their father  left his fortune to Raymond,  who doesn't understand \n    the concept of money. Charley is enraged by what has happened and by \n    his father keeping Raymond's existence from him for his entire life. \n    He kidnaps Raymond from his care home  but when he tries to get back \n    to LA finds that Raymond will only fly Qantas.  The two begin a long \n    road trip that will lead them to an understanding of each other.     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n     -                                                            \n   NOTES                                                           \n      \n                                                                         \n      Anyone querying the AR should know that i cropped 4 pixels from    \n      the top and bottom and 12 pixels from the left and right of the    \n      720x576 source, and that this cropping when resizing to 608x352    \n      gives an AR error of -0.887%.

Therefore we decided to     \n     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             \n     'INTERNAL' tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't         \n     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   \n     are and keep being non-competitive.                                 \n                                                                         \n     Know anyone who likes our releases, and wants to help out?
