His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the River Styx, who ferries souls to the &quot;Underworld&quot; where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f558642c904cf1d7ef99962da851c22ed7cb60ee","amp;dn":"Yu+Yu+Hakusho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f558642c904cf1d7ef99962da851c22ed7cb60ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,88,100,44,144,76,241,215,239,153,150,45,168,81,194,46,215,203,96,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
