So any suggestion to help me improve seeding is welcome. Thanks for the patience. \nThis time I decided to leave at it is only RAR it to be only a file a little more compressed. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5600846513aad05b1dc0c3883b52b76464aabc4a","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+2%3A+The+Classified+Cerberus+Archives.+Double+Layer+Ve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5600846513aad05b1dc0c3883b52b76464aabc4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,0,132,101,19,170,208,91,29,192,195,136,59,82,183,100,100,170,188,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
