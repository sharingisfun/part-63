Their reunion is short-lived as a terrified traveler wanders into the village saying that a monstrous winged creature attacked him. The onlookers scoff in disbelief but at once The Jabberwock descends upon them with the body of a dragon, the head of a gruesome insect and deadly claws. Alec and his brother draws their swords and charges the beast, but to little effect. At dawn the next day, the men of the village arm themselves and go off in search of the terrible scourge. While his brother crafts a new type of weapon, the prophecied Vorpal Sword, Alec steals one of the JabberwockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eggs, evidence that this monster wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be the only one of its kind for long. Now the brothers must stand together, wield the Vorpal sword and fight to save their home and loved ones\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n::Note::\nA video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n::Support::\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...to provide you this movie..\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n::RECOMMENDED MEDIA PLAYE::\n&gt;VLC Media Player&lt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd5f0c30ef16f7e0a7fd83a025b4a7c10451cd8","amp;dn":"Jabberwock+%282011%29+%5BR5-350mb%5D+BHATTI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd5f0c30ef16f7e0a7fd83a025b4a7c10451cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,213,240,195,14,241,111,126,10,127,216,58,2,91,74,124,16,69,28,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
