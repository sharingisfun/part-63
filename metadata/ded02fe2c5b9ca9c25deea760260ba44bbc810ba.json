Now Head of Security at Buckingham Palace car park, he is surprisingly appointed as Royal Bodyguard after saving the Queen's life in an act of bravery on the day of the State Opening of Parliament. This is much to the frustration of Hubble's boss Colonel Dennis Whittington, who is desperate to see the back of Hubble and knows only too well about his relentless mishaps.\n\nHubble takes his new role very seriously but soon manages to upset foreign ambassadors, his colleagues and members of the public as he haphazardly carries out his security checks and takes on personal rescue missions for the Queen and her family. Hubble manages to endanger Royal security repeatedly and on a colossal scale, yet somehow comes up smelling of roses every time.\n\n\n\nCredits\nDavid Jason\nGeoffrey Whitehead\nTimothy Bentinck\nTim Downie\nDavid Walliams\n\n\n\nThe Royal Bodyguard - S01 - E01 - The Limping Assassin\nThe Royal Bodyguard - S01 - E02 - The Siege Of Blenheim Square\nThe Royal Bodyguard - S01 - E03 - Bullets Over Broad Street\nThe Royal Bodyguard - S01 - E04 - The Royal Art Of Blackmail\nThe Royal Bodyguard - S01 - E05 - The Perils Of Attraction\nThe Royal Bodyguard - S01 - E06 - A Watery Grave\n\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 28mn 56s\nBit rate                                 : 1 573 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\n\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 28mn 56s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 105 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ded02fe2c5b9ca9c25deea760260ba44bbc810ba","amp;dn":"BBC+-+The+Royal+Bodyguard+-+Series+01+-+TvRip+-+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ded02fe2c5b9ca9c25deea760260ba44bbc810ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,208,47,226,197,185,202,156,37,222,234,118,2,96,186,68,187,200,16,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
