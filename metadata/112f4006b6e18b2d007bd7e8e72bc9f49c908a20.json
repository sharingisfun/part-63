They find send a strange print \n     found at one of the crime scenes and it is sent to the Department of \n     Agriculture.  Doctor Harold Medford and his daughter Doctor Patricia \n     Medford arrive  and ask  to be  taken  to the scene  of some  of the \n     disappearances.  When  they  get  there  they  are  shocked  to find \n     gigantic ants,  whose mutations were caused by the first atomic bomb \n     explosion  nine years earlier.  They manage  to destroy  the nest of \n     ants,  but not before  two winged queen ants  and a couple of drones \n     have hatched and escaped the nest.  Now it is a race against time to \n     find the  two queen ants  before they  can establish  more nests and \n     hatch more queens.                                                   \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n      -                                                            \n    iNFO                                                            \n       \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n      After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   \n      work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     \n      enable more sites to host our releases by including the             \n      'INTERNAL' tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't         \n      internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   \n      are and keep being non-competitive.                                 \n                                                                          \n      Know anyone who likes our releases, and wants to help out?
