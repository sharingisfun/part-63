In the late 1980s the orphaned Karl Koch invests his heritage in a flat and a home computer. At first he dials up to bulletin boards to discuss conspiracy theories inspired by his favorite novel, R.A. Wilson's &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, but soon he and his friend David start breaking into government and military computers. Pepe, one of Karl's rather criminal acquaintances senses that there is money in computer cracking - he travels to east Berlin and tries to contact the KGB. \n\n\nI admit the quality is very bad.I upped it since I couldn't find this movie anywhere on the internet.If anybody owns it, Please upload it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e82e2e4a7258f9c49178b59ff884b8dc2fa2c3a0","amp;dn":"23+-+Nichts+Ist+So+Wie+Es+Scheint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e82e2e4a7258f9c49178b59ff884b8dc2fa2c3a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,46,46,74,114,88,249,196,145,120,181,159,248,132,184,220,47,162,195,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
