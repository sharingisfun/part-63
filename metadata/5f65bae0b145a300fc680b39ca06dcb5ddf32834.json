Though on     |\n|   their fifth album Something For Kate are able to merge both these genres   |\n|   together and create what they have called Desert Lights.                   |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Their previous release The Official Fiction - an album that this           |\n|   reviewer adores too much for his own good - left the basic three piece     |\n|   sound that they had stuck to for so many years, by adding orchestral       |\n|   arrangements to many of the songs, though Desert Lights returns us back    |\n|   to the original Something For Kate sound. When recording this album, it    |\n|   was no secret that Paul Dempsey had suffered a case of writers block,      |\n|   though on the opening track `California' he sings, with much sarcasm       |\n|   &quot;It's a beautiful life&quot; and by the end you as the listener are quite       |\n|   confused to whether Dempsey is trying to force himself to believe it       |\n|   since his lyrics are often plagued with many depressing references.        |\n|                                                                              |\n|   As the album continues through each track, new sounds appear that you      |\n|   can't quite compare to anything else. And it becomes obvious that this     |\n|   band is taking things to a completely different place. `This Is The        |\n|   Life' with Dempsey's beautiful voice floating above the driving guitar,    |\n|   and then there is `Was Outed To Sea' with an almost lullaby like piano     |\n|   accompaniment giving Something For Kate a totally different sound. The     |\n|   band also keeps the melodic feeling that they showed with their past two   |\n|   albums, but unlike the others these songs seemed to be soaked in           |\n|   darkness. The passion of the band is also at large here and makes          |\n|   Something For Kate's previous outings look like a happy Christmas day.     |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Desert Lights shows even with a case of writers block, Something For       |\n|   Kate are still some of the best writers in the business. Instead of        |\n|   sitting with the common trend they do things differently, with intricate   |\n|   melodies and guitar solos that you can tell Dempsey has spent hours        |\n|   thinking over. Plus Stephanie Ashworth's smooth bass lines and Clint       |\n|   Hyndman's erratic drumming and you have a band to be reckoned with.        |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Backing up the amazing release that The Official Fiction is, it was        |\n|   always going to be a hard task, and even more difficult when Dempsey,      |\n|   the band's main contributor is suffering writers block, though Something   |\n|   For Kate have added quite a fantastic album to their catalogue with        |\n|   Desert Lights. This is poetic depression at its best.                      |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n    +------------+\n+---+ Track List +-------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   +------------+                                                             |\n|   No. | Title                                                  | Duration    |\n|   ----+--------------------------------------------------------+----------   |\n|   001 | California ........................................... | 00h03m43s   |\n|   002 | Down the Garden Path ................................. | 00h04m54s   |\n|   003 | Cigarettes and Suitcases ............................. | 00h04m04s   |\n|   004 | This is the Life for Me .............................. | 00h03m59s   |\n|   005 | A Fool's History, Part 1 ............................. | 00h03m37s   |\n|   006 | Oh Kamikaze .......................................... | 00h03m56s   |\n|   007 | Impossible ........................................... | 00h04m58s   |\n|   008 | Transparanoia ........................................ | 00h04m53s   |\n|   009 | Statues .............................................. | 00h04m13s   |\n|   010 | Washed Out to Sea .................................... | 00h05m07s   |\n|   ----+--------------------------------------------------------+----------   |\n|   Total Length ____________ 00h43m26s (2,605,797 ms)                         |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n    +-----------+\n+---+ Audio Rip +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   +-----------+                                                              |\n|   Ripped with _____________ Exact Audio Copy v1.0b3                          |\n|   Encoded with ____________ FLAC v1.2.1                                      |\n|   Encoding Stats __________ 972kbps / 44.1kHz / VBR / 16 / Stereo            |\n|   Tag(s) __________________ FLAC / Vorbis                                    |\n|   Includes .LOG File(s) ___ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes .CUE File(s) ___ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes Playlist(s) ____ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes In-Tag Lyrics __ Yes                                              |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n2011.12.17 @ 21:17:52.556","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f65bae0b145a300fc680b39ca06dcb5ddf32834","amp;dn":"Something+for+Kate+-+2006+-+Desert+Lights+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f65bae0b145a300fc680b39ca06dcb5ddf32834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,101,186,224,177,69,163,0,252,104,11,57,202,6,220,181,221,243,40,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
