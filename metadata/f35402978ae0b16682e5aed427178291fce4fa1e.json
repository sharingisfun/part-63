The graphs prove it copes admirably under any circumstances that were thrown at it.\n\nIt was designed to play in the $10-20 MTTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s but all of our testing was done between $3-10 simply because of availability.\nMore specifically it should perform best at 1500 chip starter mtts with blinds of 10-12 minutes, it will play great in any format but should get the highest ROI in the structures it was built around.\n\nThe graphs are combined play of five testers, who are all experienced long term shanky users and all play mtts manually profitably.\nAll the mtts are played at UB for reasons of being able to graph the results, the profile will support all shanky rooms.\n\nGet it here for free","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f35402978ae0b16682e5aed427178291fce4fa1e","amp;dn":"Event+Horizon+1.5+MTT+Profile","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f35402978ae0b16682e5aed427178291fce4fa1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,84,2,151,138,224,177,102,130,229,174,212,39,23,130,145,252,228,250,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
