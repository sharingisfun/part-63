Claiming it's the &quot;only&quot; way to fix the damn\nproblem.\n\n\nThis is just ridiculous!\n\n\nEspecially since Paradox Interactive could have fixed their shit, with  \nvery little effort, just like we did. No wonder people perfer a scene   \nrelease, rather than a lazy publisher/developer with no respect for     \ntheir customers. And remember, we do this because we can, not because   \nwe want people to get to play games for free.                           \n                                                                         \nWhat bugs us even more is that the same bunch of hoodlums, that we      \nmentioned the other day, released a fix to correct the cursor problem.  \nA fix have been floating on several boards since we released the game,  \nbut these hoodlums have no clue, that they need to do it properly.\n\n\n RELEASE NOTES\n\n\n Critically praised by reviewers and gamers alike, King Arthur was       \n received one of the biggest surprises to emerge on the gaming scene in  \n 2010. Now the Fantasy/Roleplaying RTS returns in a sequel set to push   \n the boundaries of the genre even further.                               \n                                                                         \n Our story begins long after young Arthur pulled the enchanted sword out \n of the stone, united the war-torn land of Britannia, gathered the       \n Knights of the Round Table and secured peace in Camelot aided by the    \n might of the Holy Grail. Where legends normally end, King Arthur II     \n begins on its own gruesome tale.                                        \n                                                                         \n Features:                                                               \n                                                                         \n Dark fantasy setting.
