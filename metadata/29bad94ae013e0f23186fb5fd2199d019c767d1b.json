Had he stayed, it would have been his second collaboration with Michael Fassbender since their work on Inglourious Basterds. Christian Bale was also considered for the role. \n\nDavid Cronenberg's third film with Viggo Mortensen. \n\nAccording to Keira Knightley, at first she didn't know how to play her character's hysteria. When she read some of Spielrein's notes she noticed the woman described her condition as being like &quot;a demon or a dog&quot;. Knightley then started to pull faces and contacted David Cronenberg through Skype to show him the results until they both agreed on one. \n\nWhen Otto Gross and Carl Jung discuss issues of morality and monogamy, not only are they sitting in an orchard (a reference to the Garden of Eden), but Otto, serving as Jung's aid, is dressed in black and sitting to Jung's left.\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nA Dangerous Method (2011) 720p BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr\n\n\nvideo details\n\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
