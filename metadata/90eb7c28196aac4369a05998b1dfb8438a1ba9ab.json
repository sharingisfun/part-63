With the peerless Dane Niels-Henning ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“rsted Pedersen and Ireland's genius guitarist Louis Stewart, they can hardly do anything wrong musically.\n\nThe first three CDs have Shearing playing standards, occasionally contemporizing his repertoire on Chick Corea's &quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;500 Miles High,&quot; doing NHÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“P's &quot;Cowboy Santa&quot; and &quot;My Little Anna,&quot; and offering two of his own originals, &quot;The Fourth Deuce&quot; and &quot;G &amp; G.&quot; The final CD has the threesome accompanied by strings, arranged and conducted by the brilliant Robert Farnon, and while a bit syrupy, lend pleasant late-night contrast at the end of a long day to the proceedings. This is a welcome addition to Shearing's collections discography, and a reminder of how good, in a short time period, MPS and producer Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer were.
