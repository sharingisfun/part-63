Kennedy. Now, for the first time, they can be heard from 8-CD set.\n\nShortly after President John F. KennedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assassination, with a nation deep in mourning and the world looking on in stunned disbelief, Jacqueline Kennedy found the strength to set aside her own personal grief for the sake of posterity and begin the task of documenting and preserving her husbandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legacy. In January of 1964, she and Robert F. Kennedy approved a planned oral-history project that would capture their first-hand accounts of the late President as well as the recollections of those closest to him throughout his extraordinary political career. For the rest of her life, the famously private Jacqueline Kennedy steadfastly refused to discuss her memories of those years, but beginning that March, she fulfilled her obligation to future generations of Americans by sitting down with historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and recording an astonishingly detailed and unvarnished account of her experiences and impressions as the wife and confidante of John F. Kennedy. The tapes of those sessions were then sealed and later deposited in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum upon its completion, in accordance with Mrs. KennedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wishes.
