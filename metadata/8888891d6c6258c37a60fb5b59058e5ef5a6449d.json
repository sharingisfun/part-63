After a great version of Delaney and Bonnie's &quot;Coming Home&quot; Susan and Derek gave a preview of one of the songs on their upcoming album, &quot;That Did It.&quot;\n\nNo sooner had Susan left the stage to great applause than legendary jazz guitarist John Scofield joined the ABB.  From his days with Miles Davis onward, Scofield has been a highly respected musician, and he lived up to his legend at this show.  His bluesy riffs perfectly fit Dylan's &quot;It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry,&quot; but when he got to step out on &quot;Liz Reed&quot; he was really in his element.  That would close the first set, but Scofield would be back.\n\nA potent &quot;Dreams&quot; kicked off the second set in style, and a bluesy combo of &quot;Come On In My Kitchen&quot; and &quot;44 Blues&quot; was a highlight.  Just when you thought Scofield was done for the night, he came back on stage for an epic, extended &quot;Mountain Jam&quot;!  Warren and Derek have both played with Scofield in the past--he played on and co-wrote &quot;Sco-Mule&quot; with Gov't Mule, for example--and the interplay between all three guitarists here was mesmerizing.\n\nAdd in a scorching &quot;One Way Out&quot; encore, with both Susan and Junior Mack from Jaimoe's Jasssz Band tearing it up on guitar, and you have another great night of music at the Beacon!\n\nDisc One\n\n1.
