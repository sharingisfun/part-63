Several newer songs like &quot;Key to the Highway,&quot; &quot;Gilded Splinters,&quot; and &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; were introduced to a hearty welcome. The amazing sequence of &quot;Liz Reed&quot; into &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; has a really cool tease of &quot;Afro Blue&quot; you just have to hear.
