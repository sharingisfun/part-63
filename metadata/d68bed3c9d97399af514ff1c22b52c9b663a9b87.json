Delete .DS_Store files, .svn folders, .git files and folders and thumbs.db files in seconds. All deleted files and folders are recorded in the Result log.\n\n.DS_Store\nMac OS X automatically creates hidden .DS_Store files in every folder to store custom attributes of a folder such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image. It might look unprofessional and distract from the important files if you share folders with a Windows or other OS user - for example as a zip file ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and send also these hidden system files.\n\nSince .DS_Store files contain some vital folder information they can also be exploited to obtain information about system configurations. McClean will delete .DS_Store files from the given folder (and all subfolders) so that it can be safely shared as a zip file or uploaded to a web server.\n\n.svn folders\n.svn folders are generated by Subversion, a software versioning and a revision control system.\n\n.git folders and .git* files\n.git folders and .git* files a generated by Git, a distributed revision control system.\n\nthumbs.db files\nthumbs.db files are thumbnail cache files used to store thumbnail images for Windows Explorer's thumbnail view.\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo know , learn and get all things come and join here\nLOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT THINGS ARE HERE\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents                                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1350+ torrents                                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the \\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it\\'s users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt\\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It\\'s an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That\\'s for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet\\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\\'s said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the \\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d68bed3c9d97399af514ff1c22b52c9b663a9b87","amp;dn":"McClean.v1.0.1.MacOSX.Retail-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d68bed3c9d97399af514ff1c22b52c9b663a9b87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,139,237,60,157,151,57,154,245,20,255,28,34,181,44,155,102,58,155,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
