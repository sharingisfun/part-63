Our Virtual Private Network (VPN) services will help ensure your online privacy as\r\nwell as provide secure encrypted access to the Internet from anywhere on the globe.\r\nYou want to hide your IP address so you can protect your identity and location.\r\npullquoteYour Internet Service Provider (ISP), or owner of a network youâ€™re connecting through, issues you something called an IP address. This is a unique identifier, sort of like a phone number.\r\n\r\nNot only can it be quite easy to match up an IP address with its owner, it also reveals your general location and other information about you. Every single website you visit using this IP address is recorded by the website owner, your Internet Service Provider, and others with the knowledge to do so. This information may be stored for years and years.\r\n\r\nWant to test your IP address? Just click here.\r\n\r\nWiTopiaâ€™s VPN service prevents this from happening by issuing you an anonymous â€œstealthâ€ IP address that makes it impossible for your true IP address to be captured. Nobody, not even your Internet Service Provider, website you visit, or search engine will be able to see your real IP address.\r\n\r\nEven better, you can use an IP address from any country in which we have a VPN gateway and switch whenever you like, as often as you like, for no extra cost. Switching countries only takes a few moments too. You can be an â€œInternet Citizenâ€ of the US for a few minutes, switch to UK for a bit, and finish your browsing in Panama or Hong Kongâ€¦just for kicks.\r\n\r\nYou may rest assured that when the VPN service is active, your online privacy is protected, your location is cloaked, and you may surf the web in complete anonymity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d144de90295c75e3d11ddf1d400f1f91ec1a2604","amp;dn":"Witopia+vpn+pro+registered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d144de90295c75e3d11ddf1d400f1f91ec1a2604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,68,222,144,41,92,117,227,209,29,223,29,64,15,31,145,236,26,38,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
