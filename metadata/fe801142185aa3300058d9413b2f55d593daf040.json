The Third Season can be viewed in \nany order, since there was no episode to introduce Colby.  \nHe was simply Erskine's next partner.  8) \n\nMore FBI episodes coming this weekend!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe801142185aa3300058d9413b2f55d593daf040","amp;dn":"THE+FBI+--+Force+of+Nature+%28+2nd+Season+%29+with+Anne+Helm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe801142185aa3300058d9413b2f55d593daf040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,128,17,66,24,90,163,48,0,88,217,65,59,47,85,213,147,218,240,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
