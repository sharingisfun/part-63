But when Mommy croaks, Ralph is left to discover    \n    the 'evils' of the opposite sex all by his lonesome.                     \n                                                                             \n    After years of one sexy debacle after another, Ralph pulls up a          \n    barstool in a Miami bar at two in the morning and gets macked on by a    \n    gorgeous tart named Gigi (INGRID KERR) who tells him she likes to        \n    'play all kinds of naughty games.' Ralph shoos her away and begins a     \n    fascinating yarn about his multiple failed marriages that serves as a    \n    testimonial to why an average-looking aging nebbish like Ralph Higbee    \n    might be hesitant to get involved with a savvy barfly like Gigi....      \n                                                                             \n    It all begins with his adventures with buxom 'hippie' BUNNY WARE         \n    (Strange Rampage) who turns him on to drugs and an orgy -- a             \n    harrowing nudity-packed experience that causes him to curmudgeonly       \n    lament 'these modern hippie kids with the balling and the pot... it's    \n    just too much for ol' Ralph!'                                            \n                                                                             \n    Falling for the milky-white melons (and the 'dynamite beef               \n    stroganoff') of a blonde named Josephine, Ralph makes her Wife Number    \n    One. But, soon enough, she's humping her swimming instructor whom        \n    Ralph attacks with a sword. Worse, she has Ralph buy her a pet           \n    gorilla (!?) who bathes her and gropes her naked bosom. Eeeeeeep!        \n    You've got to see how this freaky little bit of cinema obscura plays     \n    out....                                                                  \n                                                                             \n    Amanda, Wife Number Two, hires private detective GENE BURK (Mundo        \n    Depravados) to spy on Ralph in the hopes of a fat divorce settlement.    \n    When absolutely adorable stenographer BONNIE LAURANT drops in to type    \n    up some documents, the sneaky dick forces the two to have sex at         \n    gunpoint. Bonnie's nerdy secretary get-up and her banana-shaped tits     \n    are the predominant focus of interest here, and poor Ralph ends up       \n    with a slap in the kisser before it's all over....                       \n                                                                             \n    Then it's on to George, Wife Number Three. She seems downright           \n    perfect except for a vicious jealous streak and... well... that          \n    name....                                                                 \n                                                                             \n    Director HARRY KERWIN shot My Third Wife George in his home state of     \n    Florida. It's a really well acted and occasionally weird little time     \n    waster which is lighthearted and quirky without being excessively        \n    stupid -- a rare quality in this genre indeed. Bill Kerwin was           \n    Harry's brother, and he appeared in a number of H.G. Lewis classicks     \n    (such as Blood Feast), as well as most of Harry's films. Also in         \n    attendance is musician-actor CHRIS MARTELL (The Gruesome Twosome),       \n    while the mysterious stranger stalking Bill is none other than BRAD      \n    GRINTER (billed here as 'Duke Moberly'), director of those other         \n    shot-in-Florida hits Flesh Feast and Blood Freak. Brad and Bill          \n    teamed up again for Harry in the nudist epic Sign of Aquarius in         \n    which the two let it all hang out.                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
