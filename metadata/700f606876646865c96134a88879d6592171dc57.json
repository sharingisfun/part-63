Enhanced means the cars and ambient sounds have been boosted so you can actually hear them as well as the commentary (SkySports). \r\n\r\nFor the past few years the commentators spend 75% of the time talking about tires. I'm convinced there was no valid reason for the FIA to introduce the two-compound tire rule other than to give the commentators something to talk about, and I want to hear the cars (even the turbo cars). The Natural Sounds (ambient) track provides that, but without ANY commentary, and there is some worthwhile content in the remaing 25% of the commentary. I think this solution is the best compromise. \r\n\r\nI've posted a few of my earlier efforts on KAT, but they aren't in the archives. However, this one is much better quality because it's 6-channel (5.1) AC3 rather than stereo. The volume between the standard SkySports track and the enhanced version matches much more closely. There's also the Natural Sounds (Ambient) track, which is not used in the creation of the enhanced track but I appreciate the uploader (who shall remain nameless) who provided it. \r\n\r\nI've enhanced the first part of the 2016 F1 season and will try to post the remaining races. If there is enough interest, I'll upload a few more. My Internet upload speed is pretty slow, so it takes a while to seed files of this size.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t\t: Matroska\r\nFile size\t\t\t\t: 5.30 GB\r\nDuration\t\t\t\t: 1h 52mn\r\nOverall bit rate\t\t\t: 6771 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t\t: AVC\r\nBit rate\t\t\t\t: 5487 Kbps\r\nWidth\t\t\t\t\t: 1280 pixels\r\nHeight\t\t\t\t\t: 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio\t\t\t: 16:9\r\nFrame rate\t\t\t\t: 50.000 fps\r\nLanguage\t\t\t\t: English\r\nDefault\t\t\t\t\t: Yes\r\nForced\t\t\t\t\t: No\r\n\r\nAudio #1\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t\t: AC-3\r\nBit rate\t\t\t\t: 448 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)\t\t\t\t: 6 channels\r\nTitle\t\t\t\t\t: Enhanced\r\nLanguage\t\t\t\t: English\r\nDefault\t\t\t\t\t: Yes\r\nForced\t\t\t\t\t: No\r\n\r\nAudio #2\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t\t: AC-3\r\nBit rate\t\t\t\t: 384 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)\t\t\t\t: 6 channels\r\nTitle\t\t\t\t\t: SkySports F1\r\nLanguage\t\t\t\t: English\r\nDefault\t\t\t\t\t: No\r\nForced\t\t\t\t\t: No\r\n\r\nAudio #3\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t\t: AC-3\r\nBit rate\t\t\t\t: 448 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)\t\t\t\t: 6 channels\r\nTitle\t\t\t\t\t: Ambient\r\nDefault\t\t\t\t\t: No\r\nForced\t\t\t\t\t: No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:700f606876646865c96134a88879d6592171dc57","amp;dn":"F1+2016+Round+17+Japan+Race+720p+50fps+Enhanced+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"700f606876646865c96134a88879d6592171dc57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,15,96,104,118,100,104,101,201,97,52,168,136,121,214,89,33,113,220,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
