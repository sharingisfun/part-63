This comes from &quot;Ken Anderson Films&quot;, which means it is a Christian film. This was based on a true story about the kidnapping of Eunice Kronholm in Minnesota. After the movie, there's an epilogue with Eunice and her husband talking to the camera where Eunice tells us that &quot;God is really a great god&quot;. Strange stuff.\n\nDirected by Bruce Lood. Written by Bruce Lood, based on the book by Ruth Peterman. Starring Scott Wallace, Joe Greco, Wiley Harker, Bunny Kacher, Don Marston\n\n\nPlease keep seeding, and please rate it on IMDb when you've watched it (it's currently got less than 5 votes)\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nFile Name .......................................: Held for Ransom 1976 CG entheta.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 939,595,656 bytes\nRuntime .........................................: 1:29:20\n\nVideo Info\nVideo Codec .....................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x540 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .............................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1259 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ..................................: 0.135 bpp\nCompatibillity...................................: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Info\nAudio Codec .....................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate .....................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 130 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams ............................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cba5cebebde9366c44b3bb5b6edbec4906c2332b","amp;dn":"Held+for+Ransom+%281976%29+%28christian+movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cba5cebebde9366c44b3bb5b6edbec4906c2332b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,165,206,190,189,233,54,108,68,179,187,91,110,219,236,73,6,194,51,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
