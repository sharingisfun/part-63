Vail discovers an escape route via the roof, but it requires breaking through the ceiling of a top floor cell. Morgan has a cell on the top of F-Block, so Vail applies for a transfer to share with his buddy. The request is granted. On the run for two days in the woods, the two are finally captured by police in a dramatic takedown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:263ea93980a0ed5cf45bfb124ca8e00d1edf23dd","amp;dn":"Breakout.S01E07.Through.The.Roof.HDTV.XviD-Vild","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"263ea93980a0ed5cf45bfb124ca8e00d1edf23dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,62,169,57,128,160,237,92,244,91,251,18,76,168,224,13,30,223,35,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
