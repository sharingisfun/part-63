What           |\n|   resulted was Elsewhere For 8 Minutes, a fantastic debut album by a band    |\n|   that was soon to become one of the biggest names in Australian music,      |\n|   Something For Kate had made their initial yet, lasting impression on       |\n|   anybody that took notice.                                                  |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Elsewhere For 8 Minutes is really a stand-alone record in the SFK          |\n|   discography, as it is the one album that is very grunge rock focussed,     |\n|   leaving out any of the alternative and tender pop hooks that are found     |\n|   in albums like, The Official Fiction and Desert Lights. The sound of the   |\n|   band was very gruff, which suited the unique stylising of Dempsey's        |\n|   vocals. No better example of this is one of the most celebrated            |\n|   Something For Kate tunes, &quot;Captain (A Million Miles an Hour)&quot; which is a   |\n|   very bass and drum heavy song. The beat is syncopated, and the guitar      |\n|   locks right into this, while Dempsey's vocals are really a highlight as    |\n|   the flourish all over this grungy tune with bravo, as &quot;Captain&quot; shows      |\n|   off Dempsey's vocal range quite subtly. Another example of this grunge     |\n|   rock styling is fan favourite &quot;Pinstripe&quot;, a simple song, that features    |\n|   some fantastic guitar and bass duelling from Dempsey and Carroll during    |\n|   the verses, while the bridge has an almost Kidcrash sound about things.    |\n|   Lyrically the song is the usual Dempsey standard - impeccable, as the      |\n|   discussion of how things that are lost can never be gotten back are sung   |\n|   in glorious metaphors.                                                     |\n|                                                                              |\n|   &quot;You're the last day of April every year                                   |\n|    You're grey, feeling for something, anything, you can't have              |\n|    Oversize, owning the road                                                 |\n|    Pulled by a current, tossed over in the wind                              |\n|                                                                              |\n|    You focus your sights and try                                             |\n|    Try to stare up at the sky                                                |\n|    Does it hurt your eyes?                                                   |\n|    Maybe you'll go blind                                                     |\n|    Or maybe all you'll see is, all you'll see is sunshine                    |\n|    Sunshine&quot;                                                                 |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Yes, Elsewhere For 8 Minutes does not have the most fantastic production   |\n|   as the vocals are sometimes overpowering, the cymbals cut through like a   |\n|   church bell, the guitar tone is slightly askew and the bass is almost -    |\n|   gasp - the loudest instrument heard, yet this really shouldn't deter the   |\n|   listening experience, as you begin to hear the wonderful sounds and be     |\n|   empowered by the lyrics that is Something For Kate, a band that after      |\n|   Elsewhere For 8 Minutes were to become one of Australia's most favourite   |\n|   and loved bands. This is why we should all be thankful, that at that pub   |\n|   in 1994, Something For Kate had decided to record.                         |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n    +------------+\n+---+ Track List +-------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   +------------+                                                             |\n|   No. | Title                                                  | Duration    |\n|   ----+--------------------------------------------------------+----------   |\n|   001 | Anarchitect .......................................... | 00h03m50s   |\n|   002 | Pinstripe ............................................ | 00h06m10s   |\n|   003 | Captain (Million Miles an Hour) ...................... | 00h04m43s   |\n|   004 | Paintbrushes ......................................... | 00h04m48s   |\n|   005 | Prick ................................................ | 00h03m38s   |\n|   006 | Glass Timing ......................................... | 00h04m29s   |\n|   007 | Soundczech ........................................... | 00h06m13s   |\n|   008 | Working Against Me ................................... | 00h04m42s   |\n|   009 | Strategy ............................................. | 00h05m57s   |\n|   010 | Roll Credit .......................................... | 00h04m13s   |\n|   011 | Like Bankrobbers ..................................... | 00h05m26s   |\n|   012 | The Last Minute ...................................... | 00h03m35s   |\n|   ----+--------------------------------------------------------+----------   |\n|   Total Length ____________ 00h57m45s (3,465,132 ms)                         |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n    +-----------+\n+---+ Audio Rip +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   +-----------+                                                              |\n|   Ripped with _____________ Exact Audio Copy v1.0b3                          |\n|   Encoded with ____________ FLAC v1.2.1                                      |\n|   Encoding Stats __________ 958kbps / 44.1kHz / VBR / 16 / Stereo            |\n|   Tag(s) __________________ FLAC / Vorbis                                    |\n|   Includes .LOG File(s) ___ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes .CUE File(s) ___ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes Playlist(s) ____ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes In-Tag Lyrics __ Yes                                              |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n2011.12.17 @ 19:57:19.490","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdf720111d291f43404a5db66303f84fa9a2f5fa","amp;dn":"Something+for+Kate+-+1997+-+Elsewhere+for+8+Minutes+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdf720111d291f43404a5db66303f84fa9a2f5fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,247,32,17,29,41,31,67,64,74,93,182,99,3,248,79,169,162,245,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
