He finds his outlaw, who is now living the high life as a respectable citizen, although still a villainous land-grabber. In true good guy form, Cooper finds love with the beautiful young Ruth Roman, and of course, his pistol finds its victims here and there. Max Steiner provides an exhilarating score.
