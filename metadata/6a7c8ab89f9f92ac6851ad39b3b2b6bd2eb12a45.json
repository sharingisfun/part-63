Starring Corbin Bernsen, who also wrote and directed the movie, the story is set in the small town of Kipling, Saskatchewan, in the dead of winter. Jimmy Moore, who left his pastorate due to a crisis in faith, returns home to find his family and, in fact, the whole town, still mourning the loss of a family who all died in a tragic fire, seemingly set by JimmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best friend, Travis. Jimmy, however, isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t so sure. There are just too many things that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t add up, especially how his best friend, Travis, could have had it in his heart to do such a thing.\n\nAs Jimmy starts digging, he begins to uncover a mystery that lacks a solution. The story flashes back to both his childhood and when he left his pastorate, just to give a glimpse of JimmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life and what heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been through. The mystery begins to truly unfold when a local troubled teen ends up committing suicide, and Jimmy is convinced that Travis is innocent.\nAs Jimmy ignores advice to stop digging for clues, to stop trying to help Travis, he begins to build back his relationship with his father, played by Frank Gall. He also begins to regain his own faith, as he seeks answers from his Father above.\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
