In this movie-length pilot, a Mexican bandit is to be executed in the United States, so his brother takes over a train and holds the passengers hostage until his brother is freed. The desperate railroad president calls on Hank and Johnny for help.\n\nStars:\nRod Taylor as Hank Brackett\nDennis Cole as Johnny Reach\n\nGuest Stars:\nFernando Lamas as Chucho Morales\nJohn McIntire as Cyrus Davenport\nLuciana Paluzzi as Juanita Sierra-Perez\nMichael Ansara as Paco Morales\nTisha Sterling as Beth Parkinson\nMelodie Johnson as Miss Baker\nReni Santoni as Ricardo Sandoval\n\nWriter &amp; Director: Douglas Heyes\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName..........: BEARCATS 100 Powderkeg.avi\nFilesize......: 802Mb\nRuntime.......: 01:33:19\nVideo Codec...: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate.: 1Mbps\nFrame Size....: 640x480\nFrame Rate....: 29.96fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 128Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 44KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ef09c6256f176c31fdba51952e0100bfd6c6a4","amp;dn":"Bearcats%21+%281971%29+Pilot+Movie+-+Powderkeg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ef09c6256f176c31fdba51952e0100bfd6c6a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,239,9,198,37,111,23,108,49,253,186,81,149,46,1,0,191,214,198,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
