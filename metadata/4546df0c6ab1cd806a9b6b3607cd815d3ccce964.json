Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat.Since the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as &quot;advance,&quot; &quot;hold,&quot; or &quot;freelance&quot; available to guide them.A behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and players can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Internet connection.\n*********************\n*Release Information*\n*********************\nAll extra languages are ripped.\nUncompressed size is 9.86GB\nUnlike BlackBoxes release, the videos are untouched.\nAlso unlike BlackBoxes releases, the game will not need to be rebuilt after being installed.\nIF YOU WANT TO PLAY ON THE GATE THEN YOU MUST READ THE README FILE INCLUDED WITH THE DOWNLOAD OR THE README FILE LOCATED IN THE &quot;INFORMATION&quot; FOLDER ON THE DISC.\nGame automatically installs to C:\\TyMoD\\Gears of War.\nIt is completely PRECRACKED AND UPDATED.\n**************\n*Instructions*\n**************\n1. Mount or burn disc image.\n2. Install from Autorun.exe\n3. Open C:\\TyMoD\\Gears of War\\Binaries\\ and create a shortcut from Startup.exe.  If you want you can move the game file.\n4. Run the game. IT IS PRECRACKED.\n**********************************************\n*If you could care less about playing online:*\n**********************************************\n5. Create an offline account if you already don't have one.\n6. Play the game!\n*****************************\n*IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ONLINE:*\n*****************************\nAs stated above read the readme file #TyMoD Readme# that is included in the download and lovated in the &quot;Information&quot; folder in the disc.\n*****************\n*What's Included*\n*****************\nDirectX\nPhysX\nGames for Windows Live\nA gift!\nGears of War PRECRACKED\n*************\n*Extra Notes*\n*************\nThe game has a lag issue where it will lag every couple of seconds.  This appears to be more of a issue with AMD proccessors.\nThis is not a release issue or anyones faults but the games and People Can Fly (the people who ported it).  The game is 100%\nup to date, version 1.02.  The update was suppose to fix the issue but for whatever reason it doesn't seem to work sometimes.\nThe game is precracked.  No videos are rencoded and the game doesn't need to be rebuilt like BlackBoxes, but just installed.\nThis results in the bigger size but doesn't take NEAR as long to extract.  The game is also fully precracked so install and play.\n\nI tested this on multiple computers.  Sometimes it would not run automatically from Startup.exe so I launched IT ONCE with Wargame-GFWLive.exe and then exited the game through task manager once the splash screen appeared. Then it will run everytime from Startup.exe.  The game will not launch properly from Wargame-GFWLive.exe so only do it once if needed.\n\nThe instructions to get the GFWL key works 100% so I will not be helping people get keys.  If it doesn't work for you then I recommend looking on youtube for a tutorial on how to get a key.\n\nIf you don't want to play online then it is as easy as installing the game and making a offline account. :)\n*************\n*USER ERRORS*\n*************\nSome type of DirectX error appears. (dxdx9_43.dll is missing) or something like that.\n\nANSWER: You will need to install DirectX. It can be installed from the Autorun. (Internet connection required.)\n\nPhysX error. (These are obvious.)\n\nANSWER: Install PhysX from the Autorun.  (Internet connection required.)\n\nGames for Windows Live error. (xlive.dll not found/is missing. GFWL failed to initialize.)\n\nANSWER: The latest GFWL internet installer can be run through the Autorun.  It will install and/or update GFWL.\n\nEVERYTHING ABOVE IS REQUIRED TO PLAY THE GAME.\n*****************************\n*SO ENJOY THE GAME AND SEED!*\n*****************************\n*REQUEST ARE ALWAYS WELCOMED*\n*****************************\nI am a one man team who doesn't ask for help but patience.  I take request   but due to bandwidth and my personal time I can not help or up things all the time.
