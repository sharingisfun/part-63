Using the application's tagging system allows for detailed reports of how much time is spent working on different projects.\n\nSet it, and forget it\n\nStarting with Finch is as simple as running it, and then proceeding with your work. Finch will quietly sit on your Mac OS menu bar until the end of the day. No messy configuration, just turn the app on and let it go!\n\nExport to CSV\n\nOn the reports view, specify your filter preferences and you can export straight to CSV. Get control of your data (it's yours after all)\n\nPrivacy\n\nCompeting apps have a habit of uploading your content to their servers. Finch will never have your data as it is stored locally on your own machine. Finch does not require an internet connection and is completely private.\n\nWhat's New\n\n* App Group View now enables tagging of multiple entries at the same timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\n* Idle time in apps now shows up as a separate line itemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\n* Speed improvements when tagging lots of stuff at onceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\n* Memory leaks resolvedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\n* More speed improvements across the entire app\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OX X.5 and above\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162dbfca8873637bbdfaa043aa5d96303d22821a","amp;dn":"Finch+v.+1.4+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162dbfca8873637bbdfaa043aa5d96303d22821a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,45,191,202,136,115,99,123,189,250,160,67,170,93,150,48,61,34,130,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
