Inventive and stylish direction, coupled with a script sprinkled with some of the star\\'s trademark silly wordplay gags, makes for a winning show. Plus, just when you think you\\'ve got the hang of what\\'s the show is all about, there\\'s a brilliant twist.\n\n If this is turned into a series - as it surely is destined to be - it could become a huge hit for Channel 4, which frankly has been in need of a new lovable silly comedy show ever since the end of Father Ted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilton Jones\\'s House Of Rooms - S01 - E01 - Paul\n\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 23mn 9s\nBit rate                                 : 1 829 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 23mn 9s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 108 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd0fb9a49db02bee0e42992c17c29fee8f1617de","amp;dn":"Milton+Jones%5C%27s+House+Of+Rooms+-+S01+-+E01+-+TVrip+-+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd0fb9a49db02bee0e42992c17c29fee8f1617de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,15,185,164,157,176,43,238,14,66,153,44,23,194,159,238,143,22,23,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
