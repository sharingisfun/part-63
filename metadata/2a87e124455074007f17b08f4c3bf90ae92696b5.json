He sang in choirs and glee clubs as a child, but he began seriously turning to music after a tour of duty in Vietnam that ended in 1970. He independently released the furiously antiwar album Merry Airbrakes in 1973. Although he hasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ spent most of his adult life as a blue-collar laborer (mostly as a truck driver), Homans still found a whole lot of time for academia, earning degrees in history and journalism from the University of Oregon and a masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s degree in history from Oklahoma State University. He founded a blues band, Fried Okra Jones, in the late ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢90s and has fronted them ever since with his raw, impassioned blues singing, harp playing, and impressive National Steel guitar style (which he plays left-handed). His songs feature subtle, intelligent twists (he is a member of MENSA, after all) while remaining undeniably in the blues tradition. Following a serious heart attack, Watermelon Slim turned his attention full-time to music, releasing two albums on Southern Records, Big Shoes to Fill in 2003 and Up Close &amp; Personal in 2004.\n\nRecording information: Bell Labs, Norman, OK; Southern Sound Studio, Norman, OK.\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
