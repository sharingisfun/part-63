It was carefully remastered using High Quality Hard- and Software. There's no clipping, no shitty expanders, no brainless EQ distortion. Just pure, powerful, carefully remastered, metal-music. As we know, the original Release lacked in Power and dynamics - I tried hardly to improve your listening experience.\r\n\r\nI'm an audiophile High-End HiFi Enthusiast, who tries to make good, old, classic Metal music sound more &quot;real&quot;, &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot;, without using shitty EQ or any sort of cheap Compressors. \r\n\r\n\r\nGive it a try and give me some Feedback if you guys want more audiophile remasters.\r\n\r\nSource: CD, slowly ripped with NAIM UnitiServe. NAIM DAC. NAIM Amps. Xavian Speakers. Carbon Cables from Audioquest. Clean, filtered AC.\r\n\r\nAIFF, 24 Bit, 1411 kBit/s\r\nSource Files: HDTracks\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun and kick ass!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b89bd9ba8d39aed158259fa507c129a724f7debd","amp;dn":"Seventh+Son+Of+A+Seventh+Son+Remastered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b89bd9ba8d39aed158259fa507c129a724f7debd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,155,217,186,141,57,174,209,88,37,159,165,7,193,41,167,36,247,222,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
