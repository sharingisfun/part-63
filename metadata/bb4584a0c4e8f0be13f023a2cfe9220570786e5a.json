Move to your SD card.\n\n2. Play video with Gallery, or a File Manager app.\n\n3. Hit Menu, and select, &quot;Play in 3D&quot;.\n\n4. Sit back, relax, and enjoy. Works better with headphones, but I can hear the whole movie just fine through the HTC 3D speakers.\n\nNOTE: This movie was not FILMED in 3D, so it is not TRUE 3D. It is 3D that was done digitally. Still cool to have, especially if you like having awesome stuff on your awesome HTC 3D phone.\n\n---\n\nInception (2010)\n\nIn a world where technology exists to enter the human mind through dream invasion, a highly skilled thief is given a final chance at redemption which involves executing his toughest job to date: Inception.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n8.8/10 - User Ratings\n\n74/100 - Metacritic\n\n-----\n\nThis video was optimized for HTC 3D.
