It stars Jeroen KrabbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© as a horror film maker named Boris Arkadin, whose pregnant wife was brutally murdered by a Manson-like gang of hippy psychopaths during the 1960s. Because of this he has become a recluse, until, several years later, he makes a come-back and invites some actors to a large mansion in the English countryside to \\'audition\\' for his new film. But unknown to them they are being filmed by hidden cameras linked to a \\'snuff\\' website.\n\nmy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e043f6001f7a57d79d4a33e811634b958aa3f0c","amp;dn":"Snuff+Movie.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e043f6001f7a57d79d4a33e811634b958aa3f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,4,63,96,1,247,165,125,121,212,163,62,129,22,52,185,88,170,63,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
