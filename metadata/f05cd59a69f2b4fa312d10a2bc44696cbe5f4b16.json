Biology is the study of living organisms or processes involved in life. The word &quot;biology&quot; derives from a Greek word; &quot;bios,&quot; meaning life or mode of life, and &quot;logos,&quot; meaning word or knowledge. The biological sciences include physiology, genetics, ecology, botany, molecular biology, and the study of specific biological systems, such as the nervous system.\n\nBiological Sciences focuses on the scientists who explore the frontiers of this complex topic and their unexpected results. This book examines the journals and reports in this field, offering students insight into the methods and applications of biology.\n\n# Hardcover: 224 pages\n# Publisher: Facts on File; 1 edition (January 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0816074399\n# ISBN-13: 978-0816074396","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05cd59a69f2b4fa312d10a2bc44696cbe5f4b16","amp;dn":"Biological+Sciences%3ANotable+Research+and+Discoveries%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05cd59a69f2b4fa312d10a2bc44696cbe5f4b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,92,213,154,105,242,180,250,49,45,16,162,188,68,105,108,190,95,75,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
