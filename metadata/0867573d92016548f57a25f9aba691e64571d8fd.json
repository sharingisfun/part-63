It ranks #95 in the IMDB \n      Top 250, #7 in their list of the Top 50 Comedies, and is ranked by\n      silentera.com as the greatest silent film of all time.\n \n      The ripper of the VCDVault release of The General was saddled with a bad NTSC\n      to PAL DVD. About all he could do was to deinterlace it, and about a third of\n      the frames are blurry blends. In addition, either the film source was very\n      soft (not likely, since it was the same as my NTSC version, complete with the \n      same music), or (as I suspect) the ripper used a heavy spatial smoother to \n      make it more compressible. In any event, all texture and detail was lost.\n      Samples of the same scenes from both releases are included for comparison.\n      The General holds up well, even in this day and age, and I hope that the\n      Keaton and silent film fans among you will enjoy this release.\n \n                         M O R E  i N F O R M A T i O N\n \n      iMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017925/                                                 \n      RETAiL DVD: http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?item_id=7779                                                                    \n                                                                          \n     DVD REViEW: http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=1723                                                                      \n     MOViE REVIEW: http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/greatmovies/the_general.html                                                                      \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n                  \n                                                                        \n                                                                       \n     \n       \n        \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                   G R O U P    i N F O R M A T i O N                    \n                                                                         \n                                                                          \n        We are looking for the following:\n         - Experienced DvD rippers who can rip consistently in XviD/DivX\n         - HardWare and PreStore DVD suppliers (Before Official Retail Date)\n         - 10mbit+ US and 100mbit+ EU affils\n         \n                                                                           \n         email: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
