The 19 songs focus on magical practice and on connecting with natural phenomena--animals, the moon, the ocean, the sun. While some songs feature lyrics that refer explicitly to witches and goddess worship (&quot;The Witch Song,&quot; &quot;Holy Water, Sacred Flame&quot;), most wouldn't raise an eyebrow in the most conservative households.\n\nAll the songs won't be to everyone's taste (for example, the first song, &quot;Circle Round,&quot; has a distinctive bluegrass twang that some may find off-putting), but the album features such a variety of styles that all should find something to enjoy. &quot;Circle Round and Sing!&quot; is less about artistry than it is about building family togetherness. The lyrics are simple, and the singing and instrumentation fairly basic.\n\nBut despite its simplicity (or perhaps because of it), &quot;Circle Round and Sing!&quot; achieves its objective; it's almost impossible not to sing along to the catchy melodies and repeated words. Some of the songs will get you dancing too (&quot;Heat of Our Heart's Desire&quot;), and others are deeply spiritually uplifting (&quot;Dance the Gift of the Summer Sun&quot;). The album is a must for any pagan family, indeed for any family with a reverence for the natural world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14df7a3f44c0486a8e37774bf8d3d05829cbae31","amp;dn":"Anne+Hill+-+Circle+Round+and+Sing+%282000%29++%5B1+CD+-+19MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14df7a3f44c0486a8e37774bf8d3d05829cbae31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,223,122,63,68,192,72,106,142,55,119,75,248,211,208,88,41,203,174,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
