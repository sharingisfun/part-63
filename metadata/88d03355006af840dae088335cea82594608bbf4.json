Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, has helped scientists unlock the secrets of life as the subject of thousands of genetic experiments.\n\nUsing specialist photography and 3D animation the programme explores the fly's world, meeting gay, drunk and violent flies, as well as mutants high on crack cocaine, all lovingly raised by a slightly obsessed breed of scientists past and present. And the fruit fly may now even help us find a cure for cancer.\n\nDVD-R capture : \nVideo: MP4 XviD 2pass mpeg\nAudio: MP3 lame 192Kbps\n\nEnjoy,\n\nPls help seed!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d03355006af840dae088335cea82594608bbf4","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Superfly+XviD+MP3+REPACK.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d03355006af840dae088335cea82594608bbf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,208,51,85,0,106,248,64,218,224,136,51,92,234,130,89,70,8,187,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
