The first of what are to be many missions to the lunar surface was designed to find the frozen water needed to prepare to build a base to launch an assault on Mars. \n\nBut a shocking discovery at Shackleton Crater brings the first Prometheus mission to an abrupt halt. Remote robots uncover human skeletal remains and a base that had been destroyed countless millennia ago. The information is sent back to earth where forensic analysis at NASA reveals the corpse to be over seven hundred million years old. \n\nA secret this devastating cannot be kept forever, and the news is leaked to the world.  Soon nations are thrown into a head-long collision, pitting governments against their own citizens as the flames of fundamentalism start a conflagration that threatens to engulf the world as a race to return the moon is on.            \n\nThe Event Group is tasked to unravel the mystery and to offer something that can either explain our ancient visitor or, at least, keep the world from descending into chaos. Colonel Jack Collins once again leads a team of the world's greatest scientists and philosophers on a journey that will take the Event Group to the airless world of space. But while a battle rages over the truth of our heritage, the Event Group realizes that this may not be humanityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s war alone. Could something elseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½someone elseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½be coming to finish a war that they started almost a billion years ago?\n\nIncluded Formats: epub, lit, lrf, and mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9804b0df2362dc2ba9c82c3a3d8d00bb33b1a3a2","amp;dn":"David+Lynn+Golemon+-+Book+6+-+Legacy%3B+An+Event+Group+Thriller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9804b0df2362dc2ba9c82c3a3d8d00bb33b1a3a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,4,176,223,35,98,220,43,169,200,44,58,61,141,0,187,51,177,163,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
