Created by Zwar, Gann and Rogers, it was based on their award-winning 2002 short film and later adapted to a series. The story follows the lives of the eponymous dog Wilfred, his owner Sarah, and her boyfriend Adam, who sees Wilfred as a man in a dog suit.\n\nTwo seasons were broadcast on SBS One ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the first in 2007 and the second in 2010. The series won three AFI Awards and was nominated for a Logie.\n\nIndependent Film Channel acquired the international broadcast rights to the original two seasons of Wilfred in 2010. A U.S. version premiered on the cable channel FX on 23 June 2011.\n\n[img]http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/4507/wilfreds02e01kissmekataqmzt.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/7377/wilfreds02e01kissmekata.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/7537/wilfreds02e02dogofatown.jpg[/img]\n\n\nWilfred received generally positive reviews, and surprised critics by winning the 2007 AFI Award for Best Comedy over The Chaser\\'s War on Everything, despite achieving only a tenth of The Chaser\\'s audience. Adam Zwar also won the award for Best Performance in a TV Comedy for his portrayal of Adam.\n\nThe series was widely praised for its original premise. Melinda Houston, writing in The Age, called Wilfred \\&quot;a magnificent creation, magnificently realised\\&quot;, and that \\&quot;operating from a deeply non-PC premise, Wilfred manages to be both broad and subtle, hilarious and creepy, utterly obvious and way-way-way left-field\\&quot;. Phillipa Hawker, also in The Age, called Wilfred \\&quot;An entertaining mixture of character-based comedy and quiet absurdity\\&quot;. Natalie Craig from the Sydney Morning Herald compared the show favourably with another successful suburban comedy, saying \\&quot;while Kath and Kim was straightforward suburban satire, Wilfred is a more complex beast that deserves a tasty snack for effort and originality\\&quot;.\n\nConversely, Jim Schembri of the Sydney Morning Herald called the concept \\&quot;muddled\\&quot;, criticising the show for everything from its character development and humour to its 16:9 aspect ratio, and wondering \\&quot;how a show as lame as this ever got on the air\\&quot;. Paul Kalina, writing in The Age, dismissed Wilfred as a \\&quot;bogan show\\&quot;, saying of the decision to discontinue it after the second season \\&quot;There\\'s only so far the conceit can stretch and one senses that Gann and Zwar know this\\&quot;.\n\nThe show was criticised in March 2010 when the Herald Sun reported that up to A$1.5M of government money had been allocated to the production of a series \\&quot;peppered with profanity, full-frontal nudity and jokes about rape\\&quot;. Family First Party Senator Steve Fielding accused the show of displaying \\&quot;acts of bestiality\\&quot;. SBS responded to the criticism by stating that \\&quot;The money that has been invested(...) is in no way outlandish. Wilfred would cost far less to make than your average drama.\\&quot;\n\n\n\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_(TV_series)[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0899203/[/url]\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/7537/wilfreds02e02dogofatown.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/6289/wilfreds02e03dogofatown.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/3006/wilfreds02e05icedogcome.jpg[/img]\n\n\nFile info:\nVideo - AVI, XviD, 624 x 352 pixels, 16/9, 25.000 fps, 901 Kbps\nAudio - MPEG-1 Audio layer 3, Joint stereo, 127 Kbps, VBR, 2 channels, 48 KHz, 16 bits, LAME3.97 \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4b98e95dd1ae75c46db39fc0ecf4b3a387c242f","amp;dn":"Wilfred+%5BAustralia%2C+Complete+series%2C+Xvid%2C+Mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4b98e95dd1ae75c46db39fc0ecf4b3a387c242f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,185,142,149,221,26,231,92,70,219,57,252,14,207,75,58,56,124,36,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
