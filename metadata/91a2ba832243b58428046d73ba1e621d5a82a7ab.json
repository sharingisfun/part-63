But when his agency superiors learn of an attempt against the Chinese premierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life, they must hunt down the highly unorthodox agent. Now that the world needs him once again, Johnny English is back in action. With one shot at redemption, he must employ the latest in hi-tech gadgets to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout the KGB, CIA and even MI-7. With mere days until a heads of state conference, one man must use every trick in his playbook to protect us all. For Johnny English, disaster may be an option, but failure never is.\n\nGenre: Adventure | Comedy | Thriller\nIMDB rating: 7.2/10\nDirected by: Oliver Parker\nStarring: Rowan Atkinson, Rosamund Pike and Dominic West\n\nRelease Name: Johnny English Reborn 2011 DVDRiP XViD-Lebo\nSize: 1.16 GB\nQuality: 1 024ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€576 | 1506kbps | 25.000fps | 192 kb/s\nRuntime: 1 h 37 mins \n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a2ba832243b58428046d73ba1e621d5a82a7ab","amp;dn":"Johnny+English+Reborn+2011+DVDRIP+Xvid-lebo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a2ba832243b58428046d73ba1e621d5a82a7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,162,186,131,34,67,181,132,40,4,109,115,186,30,98,29,90,130,167,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
