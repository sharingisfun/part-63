(1974)\r\n\r\nFrom The Broadway Theatre Archive presented on PBS Theatre In America\r\n  A Kultur dvd\r\n\t\r\nOriginally produced in 1974 as a segment of the PBS series Theater in America.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\nwritten by Marsha Sheiness\r\ndirected by Harold Scott and Peter Levin\r\n \t\r\nVideo, Victor Caravella, Jr. ; \r\ncameramen, Walter Edel, \r\nMartin Gross, \r\nFrank Polizzotto ; \r\nvideotape editor, John J. Godfrey.\r\n \t\r\nHost, Hal Holbrook  (this file does not have the Holbrook introduction.)\r\n\r\nCast \t\r\n    Diane Danzi,\r\n    Rosemary DeAngelis,\r\n    Jean DeBaer, \r\n    Helene Friedman,\r\n    Deloris Gaskins, \r\n    Marc Jefferson,\r\n    Peggy Kirkpatrick,\r\n    Dino Shorte.\r\n\r\nSummary \r\n\t\r\n   The title of this play is taken from a little-known nursery rhyme involving \r\na game between mother and child. The drama opens in an elegant reception room \r\nof a clinic where five women await a first reunion with their children from \r\nwhom they have been separated for two months. \r\n\r\n   And from the Samuel French acting edition of the text:\r\n\r\n    This psychological mystery is set in the waiting room of a clinic where \r\nfive mothers await word on the futures of their mentally retarded children. \r\nThey have been given the opportunity to change their children into geniuses.\r\n\r\nMy notes\r\n\r\n  I have never forgotten this play.\r\n\r\n  It was originally broadcast on PBS television's  Theatre in America and\r\nproduced at the Cincinnati Playhouse.  This is why I've added it to my file \r\nshare since it is not available elsewhere on the torrent system.\r\n\r\n  The subject , that of treatment of children with disorders and the style is \r\ncompletely unexpected and therefore mesmerizing.  I give away nothing in this \r\nplay.  But it is a pity that it is not performed at all so far as I know.  \r\n\r\nThere is not even a wiki reference for it.  Perhaps this instance of the play\r\non video will prompt new productions for new audiences. \r\n\r\n   Encourage your libraries and theatre departments to get it from Kultur\r\nVideo and explore the work of Marsha Sheiness.   The acting edition of the text \r\nis available.\r\n\r\nNotes written October 14th  2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e87c5179d07edd152b48ba7fcdae28e87c6f63","amp;dn":"Monkey+Monkey+Bottle+of+Beer+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e87c5179d07edd152b48ba7fcdae28e87c6f63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,232,124,81,121,208,126,221,21,43,72,186,127,205,174,40,232,124,111,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
