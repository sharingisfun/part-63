Play as Gismo, Karrie, Zero, BOW or Kami - each with a background story, unique special weapon, and alternate vehicle designs that can be unlocked. You race in five distinct worlds: a group of linked islands (Archipelago), a droid factory (Droid Gardens), a desert wasteland (Terrian Dunes), an industrial area (Sky Port) and a wealthy city (Aerial City). While racing, the personal weapon is stored in the left weapon bay. Random weapons that can be picked up by all racers are stored on the right. There are both offensive and defensive specials, including missiles, rockets, cannons, turbo, shield and a worm hole that teleports your opponents. Upon completing a perfect lap, you receive a special weapon, such as the stasis beam (immobilization) or the time warp (slow opponents down).\n\nVehicles can be slowed down but not destroyed, so he who crosses the finish line first still takes it all. The game uses 360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° aerodynamics, which allow you to drive on walls and ceilings. Those game mechanics were previously used in ATD's Rollcage series. The single player mode includes championships divided over three leagues with increasing difficulty. Each league contains five worlds, with a different theme, and each character has a homeworld. There are qualifier races, heats (one-on-one) and final races where the grid is based on the results of the previous races. You can also test drive all 25 tracks in the practice mode, or go head-to-head with split-screen multiplayer. The game's soundtrack is provided by the Bomfunk MCs.
