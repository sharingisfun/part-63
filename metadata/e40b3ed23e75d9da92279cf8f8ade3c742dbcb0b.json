He's a complex character, bumbling around town with friends\nand living in an enormous mansion with his down-to-earth wife of 35 years,\nJane (Frances McDormand.) When he learns of the death of his father - who\nhe has been estranged from for over 30 years - he returns to America to\nembark on a road trip that will change him forever. His quest is driven by\nthe revelation that his father was humiliated in Auschwitz at the hands of\nan SS officer, who may still be alive and living in America. Cheyenne's\nsearch takes him across the heartland of a country now foreign to him,\nencountering some great people as he is reawakened to the possibility of\nreconciliation and self-discovery. This is a rare film that is able to mix\nstunning originality and elegance with real humanity. Penn is riveting,\nbeguiling and downright perplexing in a performance that reminds you why he\nis one of the greats. Featuring a terrific soundtrack with music and lyrics\nby David Byrne and Will Oldham, This Must Be The Place is a genuinely\nunique film full of warmth, humour, profundity and lots of eye-liner.\n\nCAST\nSean Penn ...
