Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is the Junior Campaign Manager for Mike Morris (George Clooney), Governor of Pennsylvania and a Democratic presidential candidate, competing against Arkansas Senator Ted Pullman (Michael Mantell). The candidates are campaigning in Ohio. A win for Morris would all but guarantee him the nomination; a win for Pullman would give him vital momentum. Both campaigns are also attempting to enlist the endorsement of North Carolina Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright).\n\n\n\n\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 7.4/10 from 13,039 users\nDirected by: George Clooney\nStarring: Paul Giamatti, George Clooney and Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\nRelease Name: The.Ides.Of.March.2011.720p.BRRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON\nSize: 2.38 GB\nVideo: XviD | 3025 KBps | 1280ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€534\nAudio: English | AC3 | 448 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 41mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cfeea452a52f8e02a1322c28c9c4f48e8f88a27","amp;dn":"The.Ides.Of.March.2011.720p.BRRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cfeea452a52f8e02a1322c28c9c4f48e8f88a27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,254,234,69,42,82,248,224,42,19,34,194,140,156,79,72,232,248,138,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
