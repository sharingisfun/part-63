The film was produced by Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse. As well as producing, Fosse also directed and choreographed the concert, and Ebb wrote and arranged the music with his song-writing partner John Kander. \r\n\r\nFilmed on May 31 at the Lyceum Theatre in New York, after only eight weeks of rehearsals, the concert was shot with eight 16mm film cameras at the insistence of Fosse, in contrast to other television specials of the time which were all shot on videotape.\r\n\r\nThroughout the concert Minnelli sings and dances to a variety of popular songs and standards, music from Cabaret, and songs specifically written for her by Kander and Ebbâ€”most notably the title song. Minnelli is accompanied on stage in many of the songs by dancers and backing singers, andâ€”in three numbersâ€”two guitarists, a keyboardist and a drummer. The costumes were designed by Halston, who was also a friend of Minnelli. Marvin Hamlisch was selected by Kander and Ebb to be the music coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe film was first broadcast on NBC on September 10, 1972. Kay Gardella of the New York Daily News reviewed the film as being &quot;sensational with an 'S'&quot; and it went on to win four Emmys and a Peabody Award. However, after the initial broadcast, NBC re-ran the concert only twice more and did not screen it again after 1973. The film was not seen for over thirty years and was thought lost until 1999, when Michael Arick discovered that Minnelli owned the copyright and the two set about restoring the negatives.\r\n\r\nMusical numbers:\r\n\r\n1. &quot;Yes&quot;\r\n2. &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;\r\n3. &quot;Say Liza (Liza with a &quot;Z&quot;)&quot;\r\n4. &quot;It Was a Good Time&quot;\r\n5. &quot;I Gotcha&quot;\r\n6. &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;\r\n7. &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;\r\n8. &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;\r\n9. &quot;You've Let Yourself Go&quot;\r\n10. &quot;My Mammy&quot;\r\n11. â€œCabaret Medleyâ€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:351af456129ce010beed834a312b66fe0be7d8a3","amp;dn":"Liza+with+a+Z+%281972%29+%28TV+Special%29.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"351af456129ce010beed834a312b66fe0be7d8a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,26,244,86,18,156,224,16,190,237,131,74,49,43,102,254,11,231,216,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
