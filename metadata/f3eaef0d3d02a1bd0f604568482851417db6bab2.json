The goal of Open Drugs is to become a standard for all the on-line co-creative efforts regarding to drugs thus encouraging quality and reliability. Open Drugs encourages experts, professionals and users to review and correct the knowledge shared within the Open Drugs packs. \n\nThe Open Drugs movement was founded in 2011 as an attempt to provide a solution for the problems created by current international drug policies. Drug policy has ensured that the production and distribution of drugs is monopolized by criminal organizations. Which in the past often lead to bad or contaminated drugs which pose a serious danger to users all around the world. Next to this the violent repression of drug users and producers has created a climate that has destabilized states and killed tens of thousands around the world.\n\nOpen Drugs believes that putting the means of production and distribution on the hand of the users is beneficial to solving the aforementioned problems. Open Drugs sees locally produced and distributed drugs in a violence-free environment which are distributed on a non-profit basis. By establishing a on-line discussion Open Drugs also hopes to advance the idea of open-source medicinal drugs.\n\nOpen Drugs realizes that those who use will use anyway, those who produce will produce anyway, those who distribute will distribute anyway. No harm is done by trying to improve the situation where this happens in.\n\nAttached in this pack are three manuals, logo files and CID Guidelines. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3eaef0d3d02a1bd0f604568482851417db6bab2","amp;dn":"%5BOpen+Drugs%5D+Resource+kit+v1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3eaef0d3d02a1bd0f604568482851417db6bab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,234,239,13,61,2,161,189,15,96,69,104,72,40,81,65,125,182,186,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
