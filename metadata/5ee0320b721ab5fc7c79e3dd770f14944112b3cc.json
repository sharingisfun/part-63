It was released on November 30, 1982, by Epic Records, as the follow-up to Jackson's critically and commercially successful 1979 album Off the Wall. Thriller explores similar genres to those of Off the Wall, including pop, R&amp;B, rock, post-disco, funk, and adult contemporary music. Recording sessions took place between April and November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a production budget of $750,000, assisted by producer Quincy Jones.\r\n\r\nOf the album's nine tracks, four were written by Jackson. Seven singles were released from the album, all of which reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Three of the singles had music videos (&quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot;). In just over a year, Thriller becameâ€”and currently remainsâ€”the best-selling album of all time, with sales of 65 million copies worldwide. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including for Album of the Year.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, a special edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, demo recordings and the song &quot;Someone in the Dark&quot;, which was a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook (it's included as a bonus track with this release).\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
