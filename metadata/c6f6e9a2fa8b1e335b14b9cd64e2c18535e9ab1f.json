Yet life is present in both the Arctic and Antarctic, and the lure of discovering new territories and resources has attracted both researchers and explorers to these icy expanses. Readers will journey alongside some of the early expeditions and will learn about the conditions and life that comprise the polar ecosystems.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction 6\nchapter 1 Geography of the arctic regions 10\nchapter 2 Arctic exploration and scientific research 28\nchapter 3 Geography of antarctica 43\nchapter 4 antarctic resources 60\nchapter 5 study and exploration of antarctica 70\nconclusIon 79\nGlossary 81\nFor More Information 83\nBibliography 86\nIndex 87","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6f6e9a2fa8b1e335b14b9cd64e2c18535e9ab1f","amp;dn":"Investigating+Earth%5C%27s+Polar+Biomes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6f6e9a2fa8b1e335b14b9cd64e2c18535e9ab1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,246,233,162,250,139,30,51,91,20,185,205,100,226,193,133,53,233,171,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
