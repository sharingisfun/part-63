The octogenarian comic legend appeared alongside some of the biggest names in British comedy, in sketches featuring everything from a superannuated super-hero to a stage-struck dog.\n\n Three brand new episodes were then recorded for broadcast in early 2012, with Jasper Carrott, Lenny Henry and Griff Rhys Jones the comedians getting their own showcase this time.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_one/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_one/&lt;/a&gt;\nOur Review: \n\nThe One Ronnie was perfect family entertainment - some of the sketches and autocue gags were quite old-skool, but there's were couple of really great sketch gems performed in the show (the Blackberry sketch went viral on the internet), and the cast was really top drawer indeed: A-list greatness.\n\n\n\nThe One - S00 - E01 - The One Ronnie (60 Mins)\n\nThe One - S01 - E01 - The One Lenny Henry\nThe One - S01 - E02 - The One Jasper Carrott\nThe One - S01 - E03 - The One Griff Rhys Jones\n\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 29mn 21s\nBit rate                                 : 1 545 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\n\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 29mn 21s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 113 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:610ebbe8586689b9470a9d132b0099e2bb742749","amp;dn":"BBC+-+The+One+-+Series+01+-+Comedy+-+TvRip+-+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"610ebbe8586689b9470a9d132b0099e2bb742749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,14,187,232,88,102,137,185,71,10,157,19,43,0,153,226,187,116,39,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
