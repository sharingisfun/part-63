She's not only nuttier than he imagined, she's infinitely more powerful. Itsuki, the esper, tells Kyon that the existence of the entire universe may depend on Haruhi's whims. When she gets upset, dark gaps open between dimensions, haunted by shinji (ghostly giants) whom Itsuki and other espers must destroy. As the story progresses and more evidence of Haruhi's powers accumulates, Kyon wonders if he's having nightmares or protecting the world from destruction. His uncertainty adds an unsettling note to the off-beat mixture of comedy and fantasy that have made Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya so popular. The Limited Edition includes a second disc with the first episodes in their original broadcast order (in Japanese with English subtitles), an armband for the SOS club, an iron-on decal, a small pencil board, and a Bouken Desho Desho CD.
