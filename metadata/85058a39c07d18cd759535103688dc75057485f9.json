Having spent his career chasing Cassius, Shepherdson is convinced his nemesis is long dead, but is pushed to take on the case by his former supervisor, Tom Highland (Martin Sheen). Meanwhile, Agent Geary, who wrote his MasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thesis on ShepherdsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pursuit of the Soviet killer, is certain that Cassius has resurfaced.
