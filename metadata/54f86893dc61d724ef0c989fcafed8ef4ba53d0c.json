Furthermore thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a possibility that extremists who surrounded the alleged bombers before the attacks had all at some point worked for British or allied intelligence agencies.\n\nWith the limited scope of the inquest, family members are still calling for an independent public inquiry to get to the bottom of this devastating event.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f86893dc61d724ef0c989fcafed8ef4ba53d0c","amp;dn":"77%3A+What+Did+They+Know%3F+%28London+Bombings+Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f86893dc61d724ef0c989fcafed8ef4ba53d0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,248,104,147,220,97,215,36,239,12,152,159,202,254,216,239,75,165,61,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
