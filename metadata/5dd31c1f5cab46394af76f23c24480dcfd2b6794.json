It's been just over three years since\nErES was established and in that time in the scene we've produced many\nquality releases because of our attitude not only as a group -- but as\nindividuals; each member of the group has shown respect and friendship\nand in return offers loyalty that could only be found when part of a\ntight-knit family. We are not a release machine and never intend to be\nWe have a relaxed, yet hard-working attitude towards producing releases\nand you can see this through all of our current (and future) releases\n\nIf you feel ErES is a family that you want to be part of\nwe have listed below the currently open positions and things we\nrequire:\n\nExperienced reversers for all Operating Systems;\nSkilled coders;\nQuality suppliers;\nGood 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with;\nAnything else you think we might like!\n\ne r e s g r p a t g m a i l . c o m\n\nascii/nfo:...........ph0!SiLK updated:............16.04.2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dd31c1f5cab46394af76f23c24480dcfd2b6794","amp;dn":"Angry+.Birds.Rio.v1.4.0.Cracked.GAME-ErES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dd31c1f5cab46394af76f23c24480dcfd2b6794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,211,28,31,92,171,70,57,74,247,111,35,194,68,128,220,253,43,103,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
