Months later, he makes a landing, but, not realizing that the war is over and thinking that he is in Japan, he surrenders to Mexican police, who mistake him for a serial killer. Thrown in a jail cell with an American thug, he is to be hanged next morning, when suddenly a rocket scientist offers him and his cellmate a chance to avoid execution if they pilot an experimental atomic rocket to the Moon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f6afa17def9c360cc209f3fdb21e7a446ad819","amp;dn":"El+moderno+Barba+Azul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f6afa17def9c360cc209f3fdb21e7a446ad819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,246,175,161,125,239,156,54,12,194,9,243,253,178,30,122,68,106,216,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
