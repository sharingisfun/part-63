Extract the sw2k10sp0.0_cracks.rar file\n1.   I deleted all previous versions of Solidworks, including all folders\n2.   Disconnect from internet and disable anti virus program\n3.   Open the contents of the .iso and go to the sldim folder then go open the sldim application\n4.   Install the product with the serial number (I used the first one in the sw2010_SolidSQUAD file). If it says that you cant install it or you need to be connected to the internet just hit &quot;Cancel&quot; or &quot;Okay&quot; to continue and it should start the installation.\n5.   After its installed DO NOT START SOLIDWORKS!!!!!! I believe this will ruin the crack and you will have to reinstall it or only use the trial version.\n6.   Apply the cracks. Go to the folders that appeared after extracting the sw2k10sp0.0_cracks file. Open each folder and it has instructions where to put it. For Windows 7 x64 some of the directories you have to paste the cracks in are located at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SolidWorks Corp and some are in C:\\Program Files\\SolidWorks Corp (See below for more details).For the Solidworks Folder crack it says you need to install it with a different serial. I didnt and it still worked, so if its not working maybe use that.\n8.   After all this start up Solidworks and it should work. You can reconnect your internet and virus protector afterward.\n\nSorry I have no idea how to add or delete posts. Dont mean to spam. But this is the continuation of my second post (The one that has the 8th step)\n\nCracks location (this is what I did): \nedrawings: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SolidWorks Corp\\SolidWorks eDrawings\nPhotoview: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SolidWorks Corp\\PhotoView 360\nSolidworks: C:\\Program Files\\SolidWorks Corp\\SolidWorks\nSimulation: C:\\Program Files\\SolidWorks Corp\\SolidWorks\\Simulation\\License\\setup\\i386\nSW Explorer*: C:\\Program Files\\SolidWorks Corp\\SolidWorks Explorer \n\n*I think the SW Explorer should go in: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SolidWorks Corp\\SolidWorks Explorer\\setup\\i386\nbut the one I previously mentioned worked for me\n\nIf yours doesnt work Im sorry. But it works great for meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f281ae9fc84011095cc96f6b72679bce198966","amp;dn":"Solid+Works+2010+x64+bit----+with+install+guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f281ae9fc84011095cc96f6b72679bce198966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,242,129,174,159,200,64,17,9,92,201,111,107,114,103,155,206,25,137,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
