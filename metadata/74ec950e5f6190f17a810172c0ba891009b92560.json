The breadth of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s material reads like a recipe for American music gumbo; equal parts jump blues, rockabilly, swing and the spirit of New Orleans permeate their music along with a dose of vintage vibes added like Tabasco sauce.\n\nTraveling and performing through the deep south, soaking up the sounds of roots music forms like bluegrass, delta blues, rockabilly and swing led April to seek out upright bassist JJ Culpepper to form the June Bugs. April Mae, lead vocalist, also plays washboard and percussion with the June Bugs. Dave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCatfishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fecca sizzles on cigar box guitar, electric guitar and banjo, while JJ CulpepperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rollicking, expressive bass lines provide the perfect balance between AprilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hot-smoke-and-honey vocals and guitarist CatfishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gritty leads.\n\nReviewers are appreciating this group's eclectic, whimsical and refreshing style, here are a few:\n\n&quot;A solidly entertaining collection of American roots music!&quot; \n~Tom Cullen, Contributing Editor Blues Revue/President, Bucks County Blues Society\n\nApril Mae &amp; The June Bugs opened for Grammy Awards performer Imelda May in Philadelphia's Johnny BrendaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in June 2010 .
