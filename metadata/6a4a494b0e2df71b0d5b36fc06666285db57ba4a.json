Except that ever since he witnessed a gruesome murder-suicide, things haven't been quite right. His wife left him, he is tormented by hallucinations and his career has nosedived into a blue collar job with a carpet cleaning service. Just when it seems his life has reached bottom, Cole is called out on an all-night cleaning job in an Italianate mansion far from the city. For company he has Henry, the rich, condescending homeowner who seems to take sadistic pleasure in letting Cole think he has just murdered his wife. A reddish stain on the carpet, a knife hacking into baked rabbit, a cell phone that won't stop ringing - does it add up to murder or is Cole losing his last handhold on his fragile sanity? Kinetic camerawork and a playfully ominous sound design ensure that this hair-raising black comedy will keep us guessing until the very last shot.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1493828/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1493828/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a4a494b0e2df71b0d5b36fc06666285db57ba4a","amp;dn":"Removal+%282010%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a4a494b0e2df71b0d5b36fc06666285db57ba4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,74,73,75,14,45,247,27,13,91,54,252,6,102,98,133,219,87,186,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
