Varelli. She learns of the Three Mothers, and \n believes her apartment building is one of their houses. She pleads her\n brother Mark, who is studying musicology in Rome, to come, because she is\n afraid. Mark's friend Sara reads her letter, which he left behind in class,\n and discovers the school is run by the Mater Lacrimarum, and is killed for\n this knowledge. The house of Mater Suspiriorum has already been destroyed,\n and by the time Mark arrives in Ne York City, he is investigating his\n sister's murder.\n\n CAST \n  \n Leigh McCloskey .................................................

John, the Butler \n\n RiPPER'S NOTES \n\n The second of the three mothers trilogy. \n\n aGGr0 iNFO \n \n aGGr0 has been around since 2oo2, at first mainly releasing mp3 and svcd.\n Since late 2oo3 we are only concentrating on quality rips of quality movies.\n We just love AC3 and XViD, and love those movies you won't find elsewhere.\n We are on a quest to widen the minds of those who enjoy film, with lots of\n different types of movies, from lots of different decades. From time to time\n we may release a dupe, but we don't believe that a good release in XViD is\n a dupe on a crappy release made on svcd 3 years ago. If you don't agree,\n then nuke us. We love movies, and we love to spread them for _your_ pleasure,\n not nukers. We are a small group, consisting of friends, ripping the movies\n we love to watch. If you like our releases - spread them. And remember that\n a movie worth watching is a movie worth buying.
