It relates the tragic events that took place through the eyes of Mukhtar after the martyrdom of Amir ul Momineen Ali: from the betrayal of the Muslim Ummah to the grandson of the Holy Prophet[s], Imam Hassan, which forced him to resolve to a peace treaty with Muawiyah, to the uprising and sacrifice of the lives of Imam Hussein and the Prophet\\'s family at the plains of Kerbala to awaken the Muslim Ummah from its deep slumber. We see it is time for Mukhtar now to rise and avenge all the atrocities committed to the Ahlulbayt and finally brings the culprits of Islam to justice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d610fcbaf9198738ad8f3064801abddf47757942","amp;dn":"VTS_01_1.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d610fcbaf9198738ad8f3064801abddf47757942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,16,252,186,249,25,135,56,173,143,48,100,128,26,189,223,71,117,121,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
