Fitz takes a potential customer for a test drive ??? and she winds up in a coma.\nThe accident itself unleashes something in Fitz: the last unblemished corner of his damaged soul.\nLarry shows up on the Fitzpatrick lot intent on rehabilitating Fitz's battered psyche and the entire Fitz family's sleazy way of life.\nThis is not as easy as he'd hoped, as daily events include impromptu porn shoots, black market kidney trading, sniper shakedowns, cowboy themed bachelor parties, long nights in the drunk tank and more brain damaged sex than even Fitz can handle.\nIt???s all in a day's work at Fitzpatrick Motors. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&amp;id=191101&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&amp;id=191101&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[pre]...............................................\n.
