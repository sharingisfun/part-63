Windows 8 includes plethora of new features which includes the all new immersive Metro style UI, Internet Explorer 10 (IE10), Task Manager, Quick boot, Face password, Cloud integration etc. They also made available the Windows 8 Developer Preview copy to all the attendees out there along with a Samsung Tablet so that the developer community can play with it and give feedback before the RTM hits store. And for the rest of us the very same files will be uploaded to their public servers and will be available soon.\n\n\n==Features:==\n\n\nThe main feature that was shown is the extensively redesigned user interface, optimized for touchscreens as well as mice and keyboards. A new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStart screenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, similar to the one in Windows Phone 7, includes live application tiles. It replaces the Start menu, being triggered by the Start button or Windows key, and is also the first screen shown on startup. The user can go to the regular desktop by choosing the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDesktopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tile or a traditional desktop-based application. The Start screen also displays the userÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s name and avatar. Windows 8 has a new developer platform according to Microsoft Vice President Christopher Ham, who called it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œour new developer platform, which isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦based on HTML5 and JavaScript. The new applications run in full-screen, but two of them can be displayed side-by-side using ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSnapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Examples of new applications that were demoed include a Twitter client, a weather application, a stock-tracking application, an RSS news feeder, and a virtual piano.\n\nThe new interface is primarily designed for 16:9 screen resolutions, with 1366ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€768 and larger screens able to display two Windows 8 applications. 1024ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€768 screens can display one Windows 8 application in full-screen, and 1024ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€600 screens can only use the traditional Windows desktop. Mike Angiulo confirmed at Computex 2011 that Windows 8 will use OEM Activation 3.0 instead of OEM Activation 2.1 (used by Windows 7), which supposedly makes it less prone to cracks. Windows 8 features a new lock screen that shows the date and time and notifications, along with a customisable background.\nWindows 8 will also include MicrosoftÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Hyper-V virtualization tool. Previously only offered in Windows Server, Hyper-V will now be available in client versions of Windows for the first time. The system requirements for Hyper-V are a 64-bit processor, a 64-bit version of Windows 8, and a minimum of 4 GB of RAM. Hyper-V also requires a 64-bit system that has Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), a feature that helps with memory management. Many of IntelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s and AMDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s recent processors support this feature, including many of IntelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s i-Series processors (with Extended Page Table) and AMDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s 10h family processors. On September 8, 2011, Microsoft announced that Windows 8 has short boot times, because it saves the kernelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s memory to the hard disk on shutdown (similar to the existing Hibernate option) and reloads it on startup.\nCofiguration Details: All configuration same as Windows 7 (32 &amp; 64 Bit)\nDownload Instructions: Click on download link to start download directly from MS own server.

On Windows 7, the easiest way to convert this file is to use Windows Disc Image Burner. On Windows XP and Windows Vista, a third-party program is required to convert an .iso file into installable mediaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and DVD burning software often includes this capability.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The .iso file that contains the developer tools requires a large capacity DVD called a DVD-9, as well as a DVD burner that can handle dual-layer (DL) DVDs. Most modern burners should be able to handle this format.\n\n\n\n\n==Screens==\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/07908686756744744036.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/07908686756744744036.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/03189182512552503230.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/03189182512552503230.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/03629135869085733490.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/03629135869085733490.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n==Activation Detail==\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/66140180731275481825.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/66140180731275481825.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60826d206a3530803637973a405f5ea83bb56482","amp;dn":"%5C%27Windows+8+Developer+Preview+Build+8102+M3+32bit+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60826d206a3530803637973a405f5ea83bb56482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,130,109,32,106,53,48,128,54,55,151,58,64,95,94,168,59,181,100,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
