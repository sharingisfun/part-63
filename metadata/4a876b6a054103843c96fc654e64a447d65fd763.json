Modifications done in 3G Watchdog should have fixed (or at least reduced) the problem, your feed back on versions 1.5.0+ is welcome.\n\n* [May 5, 2011] Large inaccuracy reported on Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1v and 10.1 with Honeycomb - this problem seems to affect other data counting applications as well (so it's probably caused by the tablet itself).\n\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\n1.Improved usage by application accuracy (streaming media, uninstalled apps...)\n2.Two styles of usage graph (free &amp; pro), switchable by long clicking on graph.\n3.New feature to manually enable/disable the mobile network (Android 2.3+ only).\n4.Fixed 3GW re-enabling mobile network when externally disabled.\n5.Danish &amp; Russian translations.\n6.Misc bug fixes\n\nEnjoy and Seed Please :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a876b6a054103843c96fc654e64a447d65fd763","amp;dn":"3G+Watchdog+Pro+Full+v1.9.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a876b6a054103843c96fc654e64a447d65fd763","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,135,107,106,5,65,3,132,60,150,252,101,78,100,164,71,214,95,215,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
