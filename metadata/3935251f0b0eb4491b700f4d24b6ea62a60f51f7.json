It promises to help answer questions like why we exist and is a vital part of a Grand Unified Theory of nature. At the heart of the pursuit of the elusive particle is the same feature that makes snowflakes beautiful and human faces attractive: the simple and enchanting idea of symmetry.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 1280*720\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3935251f0b0eb4491b700f4d24b6ea62a60f51f7","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+-+The+Hunt+for+Higgs_+A+Horizon+Special+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3935251f0b0eb4491b700f4d24b6ea62a60f51f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,53,37,31,11,14,180,73,27,112,15,77,36,182,234,98,166,15,81,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
