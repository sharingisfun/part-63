This gives the film its title, but it's also an ominous play on words for the probable fate of her father. The comment pompously suggests that the people of Swaziland had little, if anything, to do with the development of their own culture. It is reminiscent of Louis XIV's alleged remark 'L'etat, c'est moi' ('I am the state').\n\nKing Mswati III rules with supreme authority, although Swaziland nominally has a prime minister, cabinet and a legislative body -- all appointed by the king himself and all quartered behind closely guarded walls. \n\nIn the midst of all the king's luxury, the great majority of Swazis live in misery and near-starvation. The country (pop. 1.8 million) has the world's highest HIV/AIDS rate (about 46 per cent) and the lowest life-expectancy (about 31 years). People must depend on the World Food Programme for survival.\n\nRevolutions foment inevitably in these conditions ('Freedom in Our Lifetime' is prominently stencilled on the back of one of the rebel leader's t-shirts). The viewer is not surprised to hear these sentiments repeated many times, a stark contrast to the king and his many courtiers, who are so detached from their country's realities that they're not sure what all the fuss is about. \n\nThe king pays lip service to the terrible conditions in his country, but he has had 20 years in which to do something about it. He hasn't, and he doesn't, and he will surely go the way of other supreme rulers who did not heed that famous writing on the wall. This film was made in early 2007, so watch for future reports from Swaziland.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89cfe69456c6915ac7411c9dc82793abd729fb90","amp;dn":"Without+A+King+-+Story+Of+Swaziland+%28Banned+In+Swaziland%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89cfe69456c6915ac7411c9dc82793abd729fb90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,207,230,148,86,198,145,90,199,65,28,157,200,39,147,171,215,41,251,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
