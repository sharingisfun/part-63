When she gives orders, Kyon, the long-suffering narrator, obeys, as do the three other members. Although she doesn't realize it, Haruhi has actually found what she's looking for in her recruits: Yuki is an alien, Mikuru is a time traveler, and Itsuki is an esper. Kyon is normal--at least superficially. Haruhi possesses extraordinary but unrevealed powers that draw the exotic cast to her. Based on a series of best-selling novels by Nagaru Tanigawa, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya overflows with zany energy. Like Dokkoida and Magical Shopping ArcadeAbenobashi, the characters make fun of the clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s of anime and otaku culture. The challenge for the filmmakers is to maintain this level of insanity while presenting a coherent story. (Rated 13 and older: cartoon violence, risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© humor) --Charles Solomon \n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FYVnMEM2L.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5280cd954638163643763c1bfe9b2b34b684cf","amp;dn":"The+melancholy+of+Haruhi+Suzumiya.+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5280cd954638163643763c1bfe9b2b34b684cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,82,128,205,149,70,56,22,54,67,118,60,27,254,155,43,52,182,132,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
