Absinthe is currently available only for Mac OS X, although versions for Windows and Linux are set to follow shortly. \n\nJailbreaking is the process by which users can open up their iOS device systems to load third party software and hacks not authorized by Apple. Procedures for jailbreaking iOS devices are typically divided into two categories: &quot;tethered&quot; tools that required the device to be connected to a computer each time it is booted, and &quot;untethered&quot; tools that allow the device to be booted independently. \n\nUntethered jailbreaks are obviously the more highly desired of the two forms, and Absinthe represents the first of these untethered jailbreaking tools for iOS devices such as the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 that run Apple's A5 system on a chip. \n\nDevice and iOS version combinations that can be jailbroken using Absinthe include the iPhone 4S running iOS 5.0 (9A334) and 5.0.1 (9A405 and 9A406) and all models of the iPad 2 running iOS 5.0.1 (9A405). \n\nApple warns that jailbreaking can void a device's warranty, and users should be aware of the potential implications of jailbreaking their devices, but most issues can be resolved using common jailbreak tools and devices can be reverted to their non jailbroken states if necessary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da92189887e8c287e66ae2f75fe13407ad92aff3","amp;dn":"Absinthe+A5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da92189887e8c287e66ae2f75fe13407ad92aff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,146,24,152,135,232,194,135,230,106,226,247,95,225,52,7,173,146,175,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
