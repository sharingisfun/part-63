Presently there are an estimated 50 million worshippers worldwide. The central belief of the religion is in spirit possession, through which the gods speak to the devotees only for a short time during the ceremonies. However, the faithful believe that the work of the gods is present in all aspects of daily life, and that pleasing the gods will gain them health, wealth, and spiritual commitment. Vodoun is almost universally practiced in Haiti, but also is practiced in many cities of the United States such as New York, New Orleans, Houston, Charleston, South Carolina, and Los Angeles. In the United States it is recognized as a legitimate religion. The major portion of this article describes Haitian Vodoun.\n\nThe origins of the word vodoun, according to etymologists, stems from the term vodu, meaning &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;deity&quot; in the Fon language of the West African kingdom of Dahomey, which is now Benin, and some parts of Togo West Africa. In the 18th century, the Creoles (whites born in the New World, usually of Spanish or French ancestry or perhaps being of mixed blood), masters of the Dahomean slaves, translated the word into vaudau. The Creole language was derived from French, with distinct African patterns of phonetics and grammar. Eventually from this came various spellings of the word, some which were considered derogatory. Vodoun or Vodoun is preferred by the faithful who not only consider their practice a religion, but also a way of life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa79b8858bb5ec578d19b8636fd788903fa5ec5f","amp;dn":"Voodoo+%28Vodoun%29+by+Bienna+Bellow+%28video+lecture%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa79b8858bb5ec578d19b8636fd788903fa5ec5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,121,184,133,139,181,236,87,141,25,184,99,111,215,136,144,63,165,236,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
