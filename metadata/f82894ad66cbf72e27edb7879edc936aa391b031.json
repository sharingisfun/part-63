At the time the company was the leading airline of Latin America with service around the world. On this 2hr video you follow the 737-300 on some fantastic and very scenic flights including an arrival and departure at the world famous Santos Dumont Airport at Rio de Janeiro. Other destinations include Rio International, Salvador, Maceio, Aracaju, Recife, Brasilia. The one flight that makes this video an absolute treasure is from Maceio to Aracaju where the crew kept the aircraft at 1500 feet for the entire 30 minute trip, something no one is ever likely to experience! Enjoy this fantastic program! \r\n\r\nIncludes flights with 737-300, 737-700, 767-200, 767-300 e MD11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f82894ad66cbf72e27edb7879edc936aa391b031","amp;dn":"World+Air+Routes+-+VARIG+737+767+MD11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f82894ad66cbf72e27edb7879edc936aa391b031","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,40,148,173,102,203,247,46,39,237,183,135,158,220,147,106,163,145,176,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
