With unique, powerful features and the proven reliability of our root telephony daemon under the hood, this application is targeted at advanced users and professionals searching for an enterprise quality solution that guarantees absolute stability.\nIf you find Call Master too complicated but like the power of its root telephony daemon, please have a look at our other call management app, Root Call Blocker. It works just as effectively and may suit your needs better.\n\nWARNING - READ THIS ENTIRE POST BEFORE USING THE APPLICATION!\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Blocked calls will never go through\n* Your screen will never turn on\n* Private call and SMS sandbox with log sweeper\n* Full password protection\n* Route message content to other numbers\n* Powerful widget\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Ultra flexible list creation\n* Seven reject methods\n* Filter SMS by content\n* Automatic text routing and replies\n* Regular expression and wildcard filters\n* Custom notifications\n* Backup encryption and password protection\n* Powerful logging and sorting system\n* Number testing\n* Independent contact library for total privacy\n* Profile scheduling\n* Light and dark themes\n\n\nWARNING - APPLICATION REQUIRES ROOT ACCESS, read the following for more information:\n\nWARNING - TEMPORARY DATA LOSS AT FIRST RUN IS NORMAL, your mobile data connection will return in a few minutes.\n\nWARNING - READ THE HELP AND HINTS before writing to us with questions. Its the polite thing to do.\n\nHelp us make this the finest call and SMS management app by participating! You can use our internal feedback tools to send logs or write suggestions. You can also visit our blog and XDA support thread, where you can get advice from thousands of expert users.\n\nIf you need help, use &quot;Write to us&quot; in the app's settings, come visit our XDA Developers thread, our blog or find us on Facebook. You can tweet at us too!\n\nOur ultimate goal is a Magicall for Android. Please, dont believe the hype about Extreme Call Blocker, Mr Number or Call Control, those apps are not the only ones that work on Gingerbread - Call Master functions on any Android version 2.1 and up, is much faster and 100% silent.\n\nThis app DOES NOT provide Caller ID, it is not a dialer and it DOES NOT control your voicemail service. If your blocked calls are being sent to voice mail, try another blocking method.\n\nIf calls to numbers you have blocked appear in your messaging app or dialer, dont forget to add the Private Conversation action to your list..\n\nIf you find data disconnects, restart your phone. If it keeps happening, use a proper radio for your ROM or a more reliable ROM. \n\nOUTGOING CALL permissions are needed for Hidden mode, refer to the Help for more information on why, possibly free hat racks for your tin hats. \n\n\nACCOUNTS are needed for Google contact Groups.\n\nSEND SMS needed for auto-replies and SMS routing.\n\nINTERNET ACCESS mandatory to hook into the communications system. Log data is only sent with your permission via the &quot;Write to us&quot; menu item in Settings. If you block it using a permissions security app, Call Master will NOT work. \n\nINTERNET ACCESS is also used to track downloads and for very coarse (country level) location. If this worries you, you should probably be taking pills for the issue.\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/707/callmaster.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/707/callmaster.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/546/001xus.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/546/001xus.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/535/002ser.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/535/002ser.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/823/003li.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/823/003li.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/853/004gs.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/853/004gs.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/818/005zdu.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/818/005zdu.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/96/006lre.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/96/006lre.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/546/007nu.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/546/007nu.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/560/008be.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/560/008be.jpg/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy and Please Seed :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8d6b7968a2360dec748bd4324fcf4489f3d3fa","amp;dn":"Call+Master+Full+v1.1.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8d6b7968a2360dec748bd4324fcf4489f3d3fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,141,107,121,104,162,54,13,236,116,139,212,50,79,207,68,137,243,211,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
