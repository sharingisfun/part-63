Due to fears that Robotboy would be stolen by his arch-enemy Dr. Kamikazi and his main henchman Constantine to be used to take over the world, Professor Moshimo entrusts Robotboy to 10-year-old Tommy Turnbull, his biggest fan. While being protected by Tommy and his two friends Lola and Gus, or &quot;G-man&quot; as he calls himself, Robotboy learns how to behave and act as if he were a real boy.\n\n\n\n\nRobotboy is a British animated television series which is produced by French production company Alphanim with TV Channels France 3 and Cartoon Network as well as Luxanimation. It was created and designed by Jan Van Rijsselberge and was directed in Alphanim's studio in Paris by Charlie Bean, who worked on other programs such as The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius for Nickelodeon and Camp Lazlo for Cartoon Network. It was first aired in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2005 on Cartoon Network. The pilot episode premiered in the United States on 28 December 2005 as part of a &quot;sneak peek&quot; preview week for the network's new Saturday morning cartoon lineup that debuted on 14 January 2006. The series is still running to this day in the United Kingdom and in Eastern Europe and Germany but is no longer shown in the US.\n\n\n\nCharacters :Heroes\n\nRobotboy: The titular-character and robot superhero protagonist of the show.\n\nTommy Turnbull: Robotboy's 10-year-old owner and best human friend.\n\nGus &quot;G-Man&quot; Turner: Tommy's rude, self-centered, and neurotic best friend.\n\nLola Mbola: Tommy's unofficial girlfriend who secretly has a crush on him.\n[edit] Villains\n\nDr. Kamikazi: A small and possibly delusional old man with thick glasses and a suit/bathrobe combo who is a self-proclaimed evil genius and the main antagonist of the show. He wishes to capture Robotboy to create a template for an army of super robots, with which he will be able to achieve his dastardly goal of world domination. Most of his henchmen have a large letter K on their uniforms, to show that they are on Dr. Kamikazi's side. He has had many pets, ranging from snakes to cats, but they usually hurt him.\n\nConstantine: A fat hunchbacked henchman of Dr. Kamikazi who also is a master of sumo wrestling (though it is unknown if he has ever been a yokozuna, or &quot;grand champion&quot;). He is a sensitive and none too threatening sidekick to Dr. Kamikazi who mainly acts as his muscle power as well as his assistant. Constantine is also a refined chef, being able to create dishes ranging from Sashimi to tapas. It was seen in one episode that Constantine used to be an orphan before working for Kamikazi. Despite looking like a Japanese version of a henchman, Constantine is actually Spanish, suggesting that his outfit is simply a uniform assigned to him by Dr. Kamikazi.\n\nDonnie: Tommy's older Brother and secondary archenemy, he is a constant bully to every child in the neighborhood, including Gus and Tommy himself. He frequently calls people names, threatens them etc, and yet despite this, Tommy still treats him as family. Some people exploit his attitude for their benefit, usually Dr. Kamikazi. His bullying backfires in the third season after Robotboy tortures him when he decides to play hooky from school in order to destroy Robotboy.\n\nKurt: A sadistic bully at Tommy's school, he has blonde hair and wears a hat. He constantly bullies Gus and Tommy, as well as any other kid he finds. His father is a secret agent who has used Kurt to try and capture Robotboy. Tommy sometimes can outsmart Kurt and his cronies and put them in their place, usually with Robotboy.\n\nSeason 1: 2005# Title England Airdate \n1 Dog-Ra / War and Pieces                                                 November 1, 2005  \n \n2 Constabot / Cleaning Day   \nNovember 2, 2005     \n\n3 Teasebots / Constantine Rising     \nNovember 3, 2005 \n\n4 Metal Monster / Time Transmission                             \nNovember 4, 2005 \n\n5 The Donnienator / Halloween                                        \nNovember 7, 2005 \n\n6 Don't Fight It / Kurt's Father                                          \nNovember 8, 2005 \n\n7 Brother / Roughing It                                                      November 9, 2005 \n\n8 I Want That Toy / Sweet\nNovember 10,2005\n\n9 Robot Love / Brother Bjorn                                            \nNovember 11, 2005 \n\n10 The Boy Who Cried Kamikazi / Christmas Evil          \nNovember 14, 2005 \n\n11 Underwater / Kamikazi Nightmare                               \nNovember 15, 2005 \n\n12 Human Fist on Ice / Robot Rebels                                \nNovember 16, 2005 \n\n13 Crying Time / Runaway Robot                                      \nNovember 17, 2005 \n\nSeason 2: 2006# Title Airdate \n14 Robotman / A Tale of Two Evil Geniuses                     \nFebruary 20, 2006 \n\n15 There's Something About Stevie / The Homecoming  \nFebruary 21, 2006 \n\n16 Kindergarten Chaos / Robot Girl                                   \nFebruary 22, 2006 \n\n17 Bambibot / Double Tommy                                            \nFebruary 23, 2006 \n\n18 Tether Tommy / The Tune Up                                       \nFebruary 24, 2006\n \n19 Shelf Life / The Babysitter                                              February 27, 2006 \n\n20 Manchurian Robot / Door to Door                               \nFebruary 28, 2006 \n\n21 The Consultant / Feline Frenzy                                      \nMarch 1, 2006 \n\nAttack of the killer G-men/ Party Out of Bounds       \nMarch 2, 2006 \n\n23 Tummy Trouble / Valentine's Day                                 \nMarch 3, 2006 \n\n24 Fight / Cast Iron Constantine                                         \nMarch 6, 2006 \n\n25 Kamispazi / Kami-Chameleon                                        \nMarch 7, 2006 \n\n26 Wrestling with Gus / The Soothsayer                            \nMarch 8, 2006 \n\n\nSeason 3: 2007# Title Airdate \n27 Six Million Euro Man / RoboGus and the G-Machine \nOctober 29, 2007 \n\n28 Foot Brawl / Remote Out of Control                              \nOctober 30, 2007 \n\n29 Hair-A Parent / Clammadon Rising                               \nNovember 1, 2007 \n\n30 Bad Language / Up a Tree                                               November 2, 2007 \n\n31 Wunderpark / Zap!
