It's 1985: the Reagans are in the White House and Death swings the scythe of AIDS. In Manhattan, Prior Walter tells Lou, his lover of four years, he's ill; Lou bolts. As disease and loneliness ravage Prior, guilt invades Lou. Joe Pitt, an attorney who is Mormon and Republican, is pushed by right-wing fixer Roy Cohn toward a job at the Justice Department. Both Pitt and Cohn are in the closet: Pitt out of shame and religious turmoil, Cohn to preserve his power and access. Pitt's wife Harper is strung out on Valium, aching to escape a sexless marriage. An angel invites Prior to be a prophet in death. Pitt's mother and Belize, a close friend, help Prior choose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b36f409d58cc1525e215ffaed43104f7fff7369","amp;dn":"Angels+in+America+%28TV+mini-series%29+part+1+iso+dvdrip+retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b36f409d58cc1525e215ffaed43104f7fff7369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,54,244,9,213,140,193,82,94,33,95,250,237,67,16,79,127,255,115,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
