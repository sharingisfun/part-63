Its public cinema release is 30 August 2007.\n\nThe film, set primarily in 1907, has been described as &quot;a time-travelling satire&quot;.[1] The Adelaide Film Festival program described it as &quot;a black and white, silent comedy shot with a hand-cranked camera and brimming with romance, action and especially, slapstick comedy&quot;.[2] Its score was composed by Graham Tardif. It is also notable for a cameo appearance by the South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, playing the 2007 Prime Minister.\n\nPlease Seed &amp; Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c51af847fc252768a61a7b858ae772844d4decd0","amp;dn":"Dr+Plonk+The+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c51af847fc252768a61a7b858ae772844d4decd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,26,248,71,252,37,39,104,166,26,123,133,138,231,114,132,77,77,236,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
