Nick Cannon returned for his eighth season as host. Howie Mandel returned for his seventh season as a judge, while Mel B and Heidi Klum each returned for their fourth season. Simon Cowell replaced Howard Stern as the fourth judge. The live shows began on July 26 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, instead of Radio City Music Hall in New York (which was the location in previous years). Due to the 2016 Summer Olympics broadcast schedule on NBC, the show took a hiatus from August 9â€“17.\r\n\r\nDunkin' Donuts sponsored the show for a second season, which again featured the golden buzzer for each judge and Cannon. Four guest judges joined the panel for the judge's cuts: George Lopez, Reba McEntire, Ne-Yo, and Louis Tomlinson. Each of them was also given a golden buzzer.\r\n\r\nInvader97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d5b1d15264ba38abb3f3eadad5c666dcb48bc87","amp;dn":"America%27s+Got+Talent+-+Season+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d5b1d15264ba38abb3f3eadad5c666dcb48bc87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,91,29,21,38,75,163,138,187,63,62,173,173,92,102,109,203,72,188,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
