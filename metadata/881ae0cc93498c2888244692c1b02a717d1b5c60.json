We don't care about the so \n\n  called &quot;scene&quot; and all the gay  rules made up by a bunch of bad-smelling \n\n  crapmunching  retards. All  our releases  are internal, all our releases \n\n  has scandinavian subs (and more european  languages whenever  possible), \n\n  all our releases are of the  highest quality there is. All our  releases \n\n  are, from 2004,  in XViD with AC3 sound.  We don't  let top sites spread \n\n  our movies, we let _you_ do it. And kids, do remember that a movie worth \n\n  watching is a movie worth buying. Always be happy and always stay disco! \n\n                                                                           \n\n\n\n                                                                          \n\n  SHOUTOUTS: COWiSO QiX SiCK RARNeT HaTRiC PORNOFORTHEPEOPLE RWH FJ0RTiZ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:881ae0cc93498c2888244692c1b02a717d1b5c60","amp;dn":"Oceans.Eleven.2001.iNTERNAL.AC3.DVDRiP.XViD-aGGr0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"881ae0cc93498c2888244692c1b02a717d1b5c60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,26,224,204,147,73,140,40,136,36,70,146,193,176,42,113,125,27,92,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
