The result stimulates the subjectâ€™s biological intelligence to do whatever healing it deems necessary in everything from major immune disorders to chronic pain to emotional disturbances. In Supercharging Quantum-Touch, prominent teacher Alain Herriott takes students and followers of Quantum-Touch beyond the basics, sharing the techniques used by the best, most effective practitioners.From the hundreds of workshops heâ€™s conducted around the world, Herriott has gathered questions that he addresses here in a direct way that refines, clarifies, broadens, and deepens the work. The book begins by walking readers through the basic attributes of the best practitioners. Bit by bit, more techniques are added and â€œstackedâ€ or laid out to create a step-by-step approach to work on anything a client needs, including (though not limited to) general pain, physical imbalances, and emotional issues. Strategies for perceiving energy more clearly are also included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8abe06b69832b51be3b5b1fa918c77193e101a71","amp;dn":"Quantum+Touch+-+Supercharge+Quantum-Touch%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8abe06b69832b51be3b5b1fa918c77193e101a71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,190,6,182,152,50,181,27,227,181,177,250,145,140,119,25,62,16,26,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
