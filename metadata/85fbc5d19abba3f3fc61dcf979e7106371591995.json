However, the workers risk their lives while wrestling with thousands of tonnes of iron pieces at the yards, which are full of asbestos and toxic gases. There is always a chance of an explosion while burning the waste oils trapped in stacks of iron. The workers could easily get crushed and killed while cutting or moving iron plates.Nothing from a dismantled old ship is a waste. A rusty piece of iron and even waste oils mixed with mud are all recycled and sold through auctions. Half of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s retired ships are dismantled in Chittagong. Its ship-breaking industry provides 85 per cent of the domestic needs of iron in Bangladesh, where none is produced.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85fbc5d19abba3f3fc61dcf979e7106371591995","amp;dn":"Iron+Crows+%28ship+breaking+industry%29+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85fbc5d19abba3f3fc61dcf979e7106371591995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,251,197,209,154,187,163,243,252,97,220,249,121,231,16,99,113,89,25,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
