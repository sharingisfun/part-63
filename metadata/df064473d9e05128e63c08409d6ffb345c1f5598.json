Monroes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJabberwockyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which just completed production and is now headed into post. Monroe is coming off the remake of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Spit on Your GraveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and previously directed the films ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt WaitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouse of 9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³, both of which I found very decent.
