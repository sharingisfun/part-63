Here, they will face one of the toughest off-road driving  \n  courses in the country, complete with steep rubble climbs,            \n  sump-smashing ruts and engine-drenching pools.                        \n                                                                        \n  Pace, toughness and grip are the order of the day. Can the robust     \n  racers chew up the muddy trail and conquer the clay? Eight hours at   \n  a scrapyard and a sack full of tools should help.
