Immediately they are further sent to Romulus, where a new Praetor, Shinzon, a human cloned from Captain Picard who lives on the slave planet Remus, appears to want peace with the Federation. But then the crew detects a break-in on their computer systems, and Picard is captured by the Remans because Shinzon needs him as his only matching supplier of genetic material. Picard and the Enterprise can escape, only to find themselves battling Shinzon's completely cloaked Warbird, who is after the complete destruction of Earth.\n\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nPlease do not hit and run...seed so others may enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcd7f2c8f2409883f4b5aea8d90e38658122c5bc","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Nemesis+%282002%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcd7f2c8f2409883f4b5aea8d90e38658122c5bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,215,242,200,242,64,152,131,244,181,174,168,217,14,56,101,129,34,197,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
