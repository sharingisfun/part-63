But, this is the IMDb so what else is new.\n\nI\\\\\\'d never seen or heard of Cloudburst prior to the recent showing on TCM. It\\\\\\'s quite a good little film - well directed by Searle, whose work I don\\\\\\'t know at all, with a top-notch score by Frank Spencer, a composer I also don\\\\\\'t know. Preston is very good, as are the rest of the players, especially the actor who plays the Inspector. The storytelling is compelling, and there\\\\\\'s a surprising complexity in Preston\\\\\\'s character. Leo Marks, from whose play this was taken, was a fascinating writer and person - as one of the others points out, he really did work as a decoder during the war - and this isn\\\\\\'t the only film he wrote where the central character is a decoder - he also wrote Sebastian, in which Dirk Bogarde plays a decoder. And, of course, Marks gave us the brilliant script to Michael Powell\\\\\\'s Peeping Tom.\n\nWorth catching if you can find it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f2cf919d7fd5160b33132ab669668f465f4eed9","amp;dn":"Cloudburst+%7Bhammer%7D+%5B1951%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f2cf919d7fd5160b33132ab669668f465f4eed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,44,249,25,215,253,81,96,179,49,50,171,102,150,104,244,101,244,238,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
