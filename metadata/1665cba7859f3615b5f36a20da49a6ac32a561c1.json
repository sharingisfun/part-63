I was turned on to him after hearing about his book, &quot;Watermelons: The Green Movement's True Colors&quot;.\n\nIn this interview for the show, Uncommon Knowledge, host Peter Robinson discusses with James the developing European crisis, the decline of the UK, the green movement, the effects of the Obama presidency on America, and the sort of future all these subject areas paint for the rest of us.\n\nIncluded in the text file are my notes from watching the program, a link to a slightly different take on James' perspective of America from Lew Rockwell, and to wrap-up, a reason for optimism given the grim current state of affairs.\n\n-----\n\nHere is the link to the Rockwell talk you'll find in the notes file.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lewrockwell.com/lewrockwell-show/2011/12/09/240-heil-obama-the-fascist-american-state/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lewrockwell.com/lewrockwell-show/2011/12/09/240-heil-obama-the-fascist-american-state/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1665cba7859f3615b5f36a20da49a6ac32a561c1","amp;dn":"James+Delingpole%3A+Europe%2C+Great+Britain%2C+The+Greens%2C+The+End+%5BXv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1665cba7859f3615b5f36a20da49a6ac32a561c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,101,203,167,133,159,54,21,181,243,106,32,218,73,166,172,50,165,97,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
