A kind of reversed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeavis and Butt-HeadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which the teenage heroes, while losers in just about every way, are also social strivers yearning for suburban domesticity and dispensing Oprah Winfrey-style affirmations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it has the bad luck of coming along three months after the original was revived by MTV. The new show looks awfully pale by comparison.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnsupervised,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which begins on Thursday night on FX, is written and produced by the team responsible for that networkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s raunchy live-action sitcom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The shows pursue a similar comedic strategy, valuing jolts over jokes. In the first few episodes of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnsupervisedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the laughs are supposed to come from the boundary-pushing (for basic cable) references to erections, sex positions, breasts, sex with angels, maternal drug use and womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attitudes toward the male sexual anatomy.\nIn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Always Sunny in PhiladelphiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the raunch is often funny, though, while in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnsupervisedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mostly off-putting; the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concept and its tone seem to be at odds with each other. Taking the comic aggressiveness of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlways SunnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and applying it to what plays like a sendup of an after-school special must have sounded better at the pitch meeting. The animation, with sharply outlined figures against static backgrounds in a style reminiscent of the FX spy cartoon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArcher,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has more character than the writing.\nJustin Long of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew GirlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and David Hornsby of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Always SunnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (and this seasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s short-lived ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow to Be a GentlemanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) provide the voices of Gary and Joel, the latchkey children who live in a world bereft of parents save for JoelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drug-addled stepmother. Adult companionship, if not supervision, is provided by a pair of neighbors, an avuncular Panamanian (Fred Armisen) and a barbie-tending Australian (Russ Rosell), who contribute to a general atmosphere of 1970s and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢80s nostalgia. Making the connection even stronger are the references to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchicksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a black schoolmate, voiced by Romany Malco, who could be Fat AlbertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slimmer cousin.\nThe cast also includes Kristen Bell, taking time out from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGossip Girl,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouse of LiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and her movie career. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s amusing as the one girl in school who is uncool enough to hang out with Gary and Joel. But you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help thinking that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnsupervisedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ would have been less expensive, and maybe funnier, if it had brought Mike Judge over from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeavis and Butt-HeadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and had him do all the voices.\nUNSUPERVISED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae58df1f436a70db5250237e4a45c26958bde963","amp;dn":"Unsupervised.S01E01.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae58df1f436a70db5250237e4a45c26958bde963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,88,223,31,67,106,112,219,82,80,35,126,74,69,194,105,88,189,233,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
