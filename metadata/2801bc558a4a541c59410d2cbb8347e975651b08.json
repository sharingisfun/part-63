If you do    \n       like this movie, then go and buy a disc, support the film    \n       industry.

Sometimes we pre also a crap stuff, but who knows?     \n       Someone might like it. Please, go and buy at least couple    \n       of movies in a year, like we do, we do that for you to make  \n       you life easier and we do that for ourselves, because we     \n       enjoy it and its fun. If you can't get/afford latest DVDs    \n       and Blurays, then go buy tickets and go to premieres in      \n       theatres.                                                    \n                                                                    \n       And one more thing.
