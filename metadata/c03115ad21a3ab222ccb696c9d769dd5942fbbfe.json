Dr. King wanted children to have access to equal and quality education; he wanted people to have access to affordable health care; he wanted shelter and food for all and for everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basic human rights to be met, without struggle. He wanted an end to unjust wars. Like many activists and organizers, like many people most directly affected by oppressive social conditions, Dr. King wanted justice; social, cultural, economic, and racial justice. He wanted justice through love and through peaceful means, but justice nonetheless. He was jailed for it, like many of us have been and will be. He was killed for it, like many of us fear will be our fate. We honor him for it. We honor Dr. Martin Luther King as a radical thinker, a radical preacher, a man of faith in his fellow human beings, even as they brutalized him...and as a revolutionary. We are of the opinion that, more than the partisan politicians and the multinational corporations who have taken this day and this celebration and co-opted it to serve their interests and their agendas, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would have stood with us. We are of the opinion that Dr. King would have supported us in our cries and our fight for change. Real, radical and revolutionary, change. We are Occupy UT. We want justice. We will fight for it.\n\nWe have complied this DVD for you. It include files for your viewing, listening, and reading enjoyment. There are speeches and even books by Dr. King himself, that show the side of MLK people are quick to forget, a side that reflects his aims and wishes and those of many of his contemporaries; Stokely Carmichael, Malcolm X, Assata Shakur, and more. It also includes the words and music of some of our contemporaries. All of these people have something very important to say. We've heard them. We hope you do too.\n\nLove,\nOccupy UT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03115ad21a3ab222ccb696c9d769dd5942fbbfe","amp;dn":"Happy+MLK+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03115ad21a3ab222ccb696c9d769dd5942fbbfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,49,21,173,33,163,171,34,44,203,105,108,157,118,157,213,148,47,187,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
