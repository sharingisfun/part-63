Painstakingly recorded over a period of two years, the rustic, ethereal veneer of songs like Ghost or the slyly comic Women in the Kitchen belies the earthy, kinetic energy evident in the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musicianship (the benefits of cutting oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s teeth busking rather than building loops in GarageBand).\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/07/28/fox-and-the-bird/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/07/28/fox-and-the-bird/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b07721d46959dda85c02c886d8e141946f0e1e13","amp;dn":"Fox+and+the+Bird...Floating+Feather%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b07721d46959dda85c02c886d8e141946f0e1e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,119,33,212,105,89,221,168,92,2,200,134,216,225,65,148,111,14,30,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
