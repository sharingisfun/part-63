Joining a \n                   Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled \n                   across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the \n                   ice, she discovers an organism that seems to \n                   have died in the crash eons ago. But it is about \n                   to wake up. When a simple experiment frees the \n                   alien from its frozen prison, Kate must join the \n                   crew's pilot, Carter (Joel Edgerton), to keep it \n                   from killing them off one at a time. And in this \n                   vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic \n                   anything it touches will pit human against human \n                   as it tries to survive and flourish. The Thing \n                   serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic \n                   1982 film of the same name. \n\n\n Notes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½: We are following CUSTOM SWESUB RULES 2K10\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7fa5fbb758816334cc6d7cc226236df74a89343","amp;dn":"The.Thing.2011.CUSTOM.SWESUB.NTSC.DVDR-Hemulen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7fa5fbb758816334cc6d7cc226236df74a89343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,250,95,187,117,136,22,51,76,198,215,204,34,98,54,223,116,168,147,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
