I couldn't find any good DBZ torrents on TPB so I bought this set. There are six files, one for each disc. They contain the marathon feature, which plays all the episodes on a single disk without all the ending and opening credits between episodes. I also kept the original Japanese music because I like it better. If anyone has a problem with this, then FUCK OFF!\n\nP.S. I plan on uploading all nine seasons once I buy them, and possibly GT and Dragon Ball, although there's already a good Dragon Ball torrent here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3728679/Dragon_Ball_-_UNCUT_-_Episodes_001-153_[Japanese_English_Audio__","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1282b7b8429315a9de9c7cdbe180b85cb83cd4c","amp;dn":"Dragon+Ball+Z%3A+Season+One+%28Vegeta+Saga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1282b7b8429315a9de9c7cdbe180b85cb83cd4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,40,43,123,132,41,49,90,157,233,199,205,190,24,11,133,203,131,205,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
