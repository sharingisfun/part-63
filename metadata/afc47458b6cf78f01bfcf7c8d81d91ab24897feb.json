The elusiveness of the Incunabula's original proponents, Emory Cranston (a pseudonym) and Joseph Matheny (his real name), has spawned wild speculation that the Ong's Hat legend is nothing but a media hoax. However there is a dark side to this story that has never been fully told, which may help explain their circumspection. What began as an heretical Islamic sect founded in the early 1900s by Black circus magician, Noble Drew Ali, evolved over the century into a techno-tantric commune whose members managed to escape this befouled world into a pristine, Edenic parallel universe, a New Jersey Pine Barrens devoid of inhabitants. This latter rag-tag group built the 'Egg' - a glistening Faberge-like device that enabled trans-dimensional travel into unpopulated mirror worlds (per the Everett-Wheeler-Graham model). A special quantum-tantric feature allowed passage for two occupants while they made love, irrespective of their race, age or gender. But wait, there's more! Add to this mix a benevolent race of humanoids descended from Javanese lemurs on a parallel Earth, capable of dimensional shift without machinery, who have been world tripping for thousands of years. You've got your chaos; sex magick; applied quantum physics; shadow conspiracy; and, crypto-palaeontology and enlightenment hopes all wrapped up in one neat package. What the Hell more do you want?\n\nReviews at: http://www.incunabula.org/reviews.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afc47458b6cf78f01bfcf7c8d81d91ab24897feb","amp;dn":"Ong%5C%27s+Hat%3A+Incunabula","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afc47458b6cf78f01bfcf7c8d81d91ab24897feb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,196,116,88,182,207,120,240,27,252,247,200,216,29,145,171,36,137,127,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
