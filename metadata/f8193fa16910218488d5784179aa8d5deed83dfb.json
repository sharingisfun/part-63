One is killed, the other is mauled. The Werewolf is killed, but reverts to it's human form, and the townspeople are able to deny it's existence. The surviving student begins to have nightmares of hunting on 4 feet at first, but then finds that his friend and other recent victims appear to him, demanding that he find a way to die to release them from their curse, being trapped between worlds because of their unnatural death.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nAudio Commentary-David Naughton and Griffin Dunn\nFeaturette-Behind The Scenes\nOuttakes\nCrew Interviews-John Landis, Rick Baker\nFeaturette-Focus On Technical Effects\nStoryboard Comparisons\nGallery-Photo\n\nActors\n\n        David Naughton\n        Jenny Agutter\n        Griffin Dunne\n        John Woodvine\n        Paul Barber\n        Linzi Drew\n        more Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\n\nDirector\n    John Landis\nDistributor\n    Universal\nRating\n    MA15+\nYear of Production\n    1980\nRun Time (minutes)\n    98\nLanguage\n    English\nSubtitle Language\n\n        Dutch,\n        Swedish,\n        Norwegian,\n        Danish,\n        Finnish,\n        English - HI,\n        English\n\nAudio Format\n\n        Dolby Digital 5.1\n        English Dolby Digital 5.1\n        English Audio Commentary Dolby Digital 2.0\n        English Audio Commentary Dolby Digital\n        Stereo Dolby Digital 5.1 - English\n        Dolby Digital 5.1 - English, French\n        Dolby Digital 5.1 - English\n\nAspect Ratio\n\n        1.85:1 16:9 Enhanced\n        1.85:1\n\nTransfer Aspect Ratio\n\n        Widescreen\n        16:9\n\nDisc Features\n\n        Anamorphic\n        Featurette\n        Interactive Menus\n        Making Of\n        Scene Selection\n\nThis is a Perfect Quality dvd rip \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8193fa16910218488d5784179aa8d5deed83dfb","amp;dn":"An+American+Werewolf+in+London+-+Twenty+First+Anniversary+Specia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8193fa16910218488d5784179aa8d5deed83dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,25,63,161,105,16,33,132,136,213,120,65,121,170,141,93,238,216,61,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
