Sonic tries to stop him, but the monster easily knocks him out. After regaining consciousness, Sonic finds himself in a strange dimension known as 'White Space', a realm where time and space ends up after it has been 'erased' by being drained of color and life. As Sonic searches for his friends, he encounters his younger self, Classic Sonic, along with a younger Classic Tails. As the two Tails determine that Time Eater's actions are damaging time and space itself, both Modern and Classic race through their history, restoring time to normal and rescuing their friends.\n\nAfter restoring the worlds and collecting all the Chaos Emeralds, they discover that the mastermind behind the now perfected Time Eater is none other than Dr. Eggman. While drifting through space following the events of Sonic Colors, Eggman discovered the Time Eater and decided to join forces with his past, Classic, self to harness its power, complete the Time Eater robot and erase his past defeats from history. Although the Time Eater manages to overwhelm the two Sonics, the support of their friends and the power of the Chaos Emeralds allow them to transform into their Super forms and defeat the two Eggmen. With the Time Eater destroyed, the group returns to the present and finally finishes celebrating Sonic's birthday while, after attempting to learn one of Modern Sonic's moves, Classic Sonic and Classic Tails travel back to their time as everyone says their farewells. In a post-credits scene, the two Eggmen find themselves stuck in White Space after the Time Eater's defeat, with seemingly no way out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012 * ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a537374135a412e19627d5bd05b74d66525b800","amp;dn":"SONIC+GENERATIONS+PORTABLE+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a537374135a412e19627d5bd05b74d66525b800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,83,115,116,19,90,65,46,25,98,125,91,208,91,116,214,101,37,184,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
