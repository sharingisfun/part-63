An increasingly bluesy flavor began to color the songwriting and arrangements, especially on the party and booze anthem &quot;Roadhouse Blues.&quot; Airy mysticism was still present on &quot;Waiting for the Sun,&quot; &quot;Queen of the Highway,&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer&quot;; &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; and &quot;Land Ho!&quot; struck effective balances between the hard rock arrangements and the narrative reach of the lyrics. &quot;Peace Frog&quot; was the most political and controversial track, documenting the domestic unrest of late-'60s America before unexpectedly segueing into the restful ballad &quot;Blue Sunday.&quot; &quot;The Spy,&quot; by contrast,  was a slow blues that pointed to the direction that would fully blossom on L.A. Woman. \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Roadhouse blues [04:05] \n 02.Waiting for the sun [04:00] \n 03.You make me real [02:53] \n 04.Peace frog [02:50] \n 05.Blue sunday [02:13] \n 06.Ship of fools [03:11] \n 07.Land ho!
