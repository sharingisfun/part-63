When Matt alone gets caught red-handed for a prank with the school band's instruments, present high school counselor Sherman 'Sherminator' finds great pleasure in taking revenge on him for the misbehavior Steve excelled even worse in, so instead of expelling the little prick, he condemns him to take part in band camp at Great Oaks, where Jim Levenstein's still understanding dad is filling in for the feared problem counselor. As there are plenty of girls in the competing bands, Matt hopes to turn his (mis)fortune around by smuggling in camera equipment including a robot to shoot saucy, clandestine material for his counterpart to Steve's hit video &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmerican Pie 5 - The Naked Mile (2006) [720p]\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436058/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436058/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n   [FORMAT]:.......................[ Matroska\n   [YEAR]:.........................[ 2006\n   [GENRE]:........................[ Comedy | Romance\n   [FILE SIZE]:....................[ 646 MB\n   [NO OF CDs]:....................[ 1\n   [RESOLUTION]:...................[ 1280*720\n   [ASPECT RATIO]:.................[ 16:9\n   [FRAME RATE]:...................[ 23.976 fps\n   [LANGUAGE ]:....................[ English\n   [SUBTITLES]:....................[ English (Can Turn Off/On)\n   [RUNTIME]:......................[ 1h 37mn\n\n\nThe movie will shift its focus on Erik Stifler, the cousin of Matt and Steve, a youngster who is nothing like his wild relations.
