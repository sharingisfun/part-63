I also have all Connectpal podcasts and Sirius and all Artie Lange Uncensored stuff.\r\n\r\nI'll stop seeding within 48 hours sometime unless I can get some support through bitcoin(other people need to seed). Send To: 1AFiKbmRUyagA2Su812YFwtap4w2w5npdE\r\n\r\nIf I can get donations at a certain rate I'll put up a 24/7 seed server and put stuff up in real-time. I can get other stuff too; I write all my own tools to auto-rip.\r\n\r\nI'd like to do it all daily but the time and subscriptions all cost money and I can't sit snd do this. I can auto-rip Stern off Sirius too every day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a009421b09d7565551910b83068f87a3bd4762f2","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+10-10-16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a009421b09d7565551910b83068f87a3bd4762f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,9,66,27,9,215,86,85,81,145,11,131,6,143,135,163,189,71,98,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
