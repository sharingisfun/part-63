The programme shows very early recordings of Dame Judi performing Shakespeare and her first television appearance in Z Cars. We see performances in classic 60s dramas, Talking to a Stranger and Four in the Morning, then show how she became a television sitcom star in A Fine Romance and As Time Goes By. Her sense of humour is illustrated by rarely seen outtakes from the shows.\n\nDame Judi's career enjoyed a late flourish when three films propelled her into the international spotlight: Goldeneye, Mrs Brown and Shakespeare in Love reinvented her as a film star and earned her an Oscar.\n\nAmong many colleagues, the programme features Sir Michael Parkinson, Geoffrey Palmer and Simon Callow.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff9aed14a5ccde781024617527c9015fae12dbfc","amp;dn":"The+Many+Faces+of+Judi+Dench+++%28BBC+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff9aed14a5ccde781024617527c9015fae12dbfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,154,237,20,165,204,222,120,16,36,97,117,39,201,1,95,174,18,219,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
