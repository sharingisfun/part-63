But there's another valid comparison that one doesn't often hear: Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Live's alternative rock sounds nothing like EWF's soul and funk, but lyrically, they do have something in common: an ability to get a positive, uplifting message across without being wimpy. EWF had some of the most gutsy, rump-shaking funk grooves of the '70s, and yet, their lyrics were undeniably spiritual; similarly, Live's fifth album, V, feeds the listeners' mind, spirit, and intellect without letting the body down. Those who think of Live as the conscience of post-grunge alternative rock won't be disappointed by the intelligence and spirituality the Pennsylvanians bring to &quot;People Like You,&quot; &quot;Simple Creed,&quot; and other enriching tracks. But for all of its thoughtfulness, V has plenty of guts and grit. It also has a willingness to experiment; during the course of the album, Live incorporates everything from hip-hop to Indian music. And the Beatles are still a prominent influence; &quot;Hero of Love,&quot; &quot;Nobody Knows,&quot; and &quot;Transmit Your Love&quot; are appealing examples of the Fab Four influencing musicians no less than 31 years after their breakup. Is Live the conscience of post-grunge alterna-rock? Reading V's lyric sheet, it would be difficult to argue with that assertion. But Live's ability to get a positive message across doesn't make this album any less edgy -- in fact, V is among the band's most confident and inspired releases.\n\n\nThis is my second torrent!\nComment if anything is wrong and, please, seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a69727294b8b16615b909e00f09c4463193f6571","amp;dn":"V+-+Live+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a69727294b8b16615b909e00f09c4463193f6571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,151,39,41,75,139,22,97,91,144,158,0,240,156,68,99,25,63,101,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
