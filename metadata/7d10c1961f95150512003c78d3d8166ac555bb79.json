It was created as a tribute to the band's earlier singer Bon Scott and included the two disc soundtrack to the movie Let There be Rock, some early unreleased tracks, a live recording from the Atlantic Records studio in New York and a remastered version of Back in Black.\n\nThe album was originally released in 1997 with the CDs all packaged individually in jewel cases, complete with full artwork. The original issue also features a poster, a backstage pass, keyring and a few other extras depending on the region. When the album was reissued in 2003 it was packaged in a large digipak, similar to a longbox, which featured either 4 or 5 disc trays. The 4-tray versions contained the remastered Back in Black in its own case with booklet. All versions of the box feature a large book full of liner notes and rare pictures of the band, mostly from before Scott's death.\n\nThe boxset was the subject of a bit of derision from AC/DC fans for its limited content - two live albums (one previously released) and a select few rarities, as well as the Bon-inspired Back in Black, which of course does not feature Scott on vocals. AC/DC defended the release, stating that there was very little recorded by Scott that wasn't released.\n\nThe box set title was also inspired by Bon Scott. Sometime before Bon Scott's death, he told Malcolm Young that &quot;when he's a fucking big-shot, he wants his solo album to be called 'Bonfire'.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nLive from the Atlantic Studios (AS DISC 1)\n\nAll songs written and composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott. \n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\n\n1. \t&quot;Live Wire&quot; (T.N.T.)                                6:16\n2. \t&quot;Problem Child&quot; (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap)       4:40\n3. \t&quot;High Voltage&quot; (T.N.T.)                             5:57\n4. \t&quot;Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be&quot; (Let There Be Rock)  4:14\n5. \t&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; (Let There Be Rock)                   4:42\n6. \t&quot;The Jack&quot; (T.N.T.)                                 8:37\n7. \t&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; (Let There Be Rock)             5:11\n8. \t&quot;Rocker&quot; (T.N.T.)                                   5:33\n\n\nLet There Be Rock: The Movie - Live in Paris (AS DISC 2 &amp; 3)\n\nAll songs written and composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott. \n\nDisc 1\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\n\n1. \t&quot;Live Wire&quot; (T.N.T.)                                8:04\n2. \t&quot;Shot Down in Flames&quot; (Highway to Hell)             3:39\n3. \t&quot;Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be&quot; (Let There Be Rock)  4:31\n4. \t&quot;Sin City&quot; (Powerage)                               5:25\n5. \t&quot;Walk All Over You&quot; (Highway to Hell)               5:07\n6. \t&quot;Bad Boy Boogie&quot; (Let There Be Rock)                13:21\n\nDisc 2\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\n\n1. \t&quot;The Jack&quot; (T.N.T.)                                 6:05\n2. \t&quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (Highway to Hell)                 3:31\n3. \t&quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot; (Highway to Hell)                3:20\n4. \t&quot;High Voltage&quot; (T.N.T.)                             6:32\n5. \t&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; (Let There Be Rock)             4:55\n6. \t&quot;Rocker&quot; (T.N.T.)                                   10:45\n7. \t&quot;T.N.T.&quot; (T.N.T.)                                   4:14\n8. \t&quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; (Let There Be Rock)             7:34\n\n\nVolts (album) (AS DISC 4)\n\nVolts is an album by AC/DC released as a part named &quot;Disc Four&quot; on the Bonfire box set.
