Contains classics and curios (many previously unreleased) from the Columbia vaults - over 4 and a half hours of music. I've played this set for years without growing tired of it, even if there's a fair amount of mediocre material included.  \n\nMP3 (320k CBR) - title and artist information is encoded in the music files.\n\nFor more information and a complete track listing on the Web, visit http://www.discogs.com/Various-Roots-N-Blues-The-Retrospective-1925-1950/release/1380603\n\nIn a couple of cases I combined tracks into one MP3 file (Empty Bed Blues parts 1 and 2 on Disc 1, the first 3 tracks on Disc 3 which simulate a country and western radio broadcast with intro and outro theme). Unless I've overlooked something else, nothing is absent from this set!\n\nEnjoy and share without reservation!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8db700b7716d57df3011c203a397f5a580758394","amp;dn":"Columbia+ROOTS+and+BLUES+Retrospective+1925-50","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8db700b7716d57df3011c203a397f5a580758394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,183,0,183,113,109,87,223,48,17,194,3,163,151,245,165,128,117,131,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
