For instance, this plays a DVD from the 2nd chapter of the 1st title up to the 4th chapter of the 3rd title: vlc dvd://#1:2-3:4\n * The 40+ --*-caching options were simplified and dumbed down to 4 options: - --file-caching specifies caching for local files, - --network-caching specifies caching for network resources, - --live-caching specifies caching for capture devices and - --disc-caching specifies caching for local optical media. All values are expressed in milliseconds as in previous versions.\n * HTTP server IP address, port, and TLS configuration is now centralized: - The --http-host option sets the address, e.g. &quot;--http-host=[2001:db8::1]&quot;. By default, both :: and 0.0.0.0 are used. - The --http-port and --https-port options set the port numbers. By default, 8080 is used for HTTP, and 8443 for HTTPS. - The TLS credentials are configured with --http-cert (public certificate), --http-key (private key), --http-ca (optional CA) and --http-crl (optional CRL).\n * RTSP server IP address and port are updated similarly. Use --rtsp-host and --rtsp-port respectively.\n * The --miface-addr option does not exist anymore. To select the multicast output interface, use --miface instead, e.g. --miface=eth0.\n * The Windows version will only work with Windows XP SP2 or later. Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP &lt; SP2, Windows 2003 SP0 are now unsupported.\n \nImportant changes for packagers:\n * The default builds now assume that the operating system uses UTF-8 for its file systems and files content (except the Windows port). If this is not acceptable, pass --enable-non-utf8 to the configure script. Non-UTF-8 file systems support will be removed in future versions.\n * The VLC plugins path can be overridden with the VLC_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable. The --plugin-path command line option was removed.\n * The default tarballs are now compressed with XZ/LZMA: .tar.xz\n * OSS support is not compiled on Linux by default, pass --enable-oss to the configure script if you use OSSv4 or really want to use OSS emulation.\n \n* The webplugins has moved to git://git.videolan.org/npapi-vlc.git\n \nCore:\n * Major Video Core and Outputs rework and rewrite: Subtitles, subpictures and OSD can now be sized and blent inside video outputs x11 (Unix), OpenGL (Unix) and Direct3D (Windows) are such video outputs.\n * Almost every video filter can now be transcoded\n * Playback rate doesn't get resetted to 1 between items anymore\n * Option --sub-filter was renamed --sub-source\n * Port to Android, iOS, OS/2 and Win64\n \nAccess:\n * Multiple files are now supported inside RAR files\n * BDA: experimental support for ClearQam devices\n * DVB-S scanning support on Unix\n * DVB-C scanning on Unix scans correct modulation/symbolrate if needed\n * DShow: support for freq and video standard selection\n * Support for VDR recordings (http://www.tvdr.de/) folders\n * Blu-Ray Discs integration using libbluray\n * HTTP Live Streaming (IETF draft) playback support\n * Blackmagic DeckLink SDI cards input support (Linux only currently)\n * Linear Systems (HD-)SDI cards input support (Linux)\n * PulseAudio audio input support\n * RTP: support for dynamic payload types by specifying the payload format in an option (no autodetection): only Theora supported for now\n * Basic HTCPCP implementation for Coffee Pot control\n * QTCapture: added support for all QTKit-compatible video input devices\n * QTSound: added support for all QTKit-compatible audio input devices\n * X11 Screen: support for capturing partially hidden windows\n * MPEG DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) support\n * Support for HTTPS is now fixed for the Windows port\n \nCodecs:\n * You can now use ffmpeg-mt in conjunction with vlc\n * Important fixes for RealVideo 3.0 and 4.0 playback, notably in MKV\n * Experimental Hardware decoding using Broadcom CrystalHD cards\n * New module for decoding EBU subtitles (.stl)\n * Support for 9bits and 10bits H.264/AVC decoding\n * Support for 20-bits PCM and DAT-12 (digital magnetic tapes) from RTP\n * New module for Dirac encoding, using the faster libschroedinger The Schroedinger module should be prefered to the Dirac one\n * Support for WMV Images, aka WMVP and WVP2, as used by Photo Story\n * Support for Lagarith Lossless video codec\n * Support for ProRes 422 video codec in 10bits\n * EIA-608 closed captions improvements\n * Support for JPEG 2000 and Motion JPEG 2000 in the Windows and Mac binaries\n * Experimental support of IOMX for OpenMAX IL codecs on Android\n * One can use &quot;mp2 &quot;
