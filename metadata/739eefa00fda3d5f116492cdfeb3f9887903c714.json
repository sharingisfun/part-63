Later on, the so-called &quot;Santa&quot; (Patton Oswalt) sells him marijuana in the mall's parking garage. Since being dumped by Vanessa (Danneel Harris), Kumar has let himself go by not pursuing a career as a doctor, poor hygiene and cleaning habits. He still lives in the messy apartment that he once shared with Harold Lee (John Cho), who has gone on to become a successful businessman on Wall Street. Harold's assistant, Kenneth (Bobby Lee), persuades him to buy a 3D television. As Harold and Kenneth leave the building, they are mobbed by angry citizens who throw eggs at them. Kenneth sacrifices himself in order to prevent Harold from being hit. Meanwhile, Vanessa visits Kumar and tells him that she's pregnant with his child, which shocks him. The two get into an argument and Vanessa leaves.\n\n::GENERAL::\n\nComplete name: A Very Harold And Kumar Christmas 2011 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1571.20 MiB\nDuration: 1h 29mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 450 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2012-01-30 07:42:53\nSubtitles: English,Romanian\nEncoded by Vice\n\n::VIDEO SPECIFICATION::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 116 r2074 2641b9e\nAverage video bitrate: 2000\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x536\nSource: SPARKS Thanks\n\n::AUDIO SPECIFICATION::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nChannel positions Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/01782251298338206388.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/01782251298338206388.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/30485626329220484584.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/30485626329220484584.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/81296148637901205524.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/81296148637901205524.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/77463800706752277704.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/77463800706752277704.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n::Info Hash:: 739EEFA00FDA3D5F116492CDFEB3F9887903C714\n\n:::     :::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::\n:+:     :+:    :+:   :+:    :+::+:       \n+:+     +:+    +:+   +:+       +:+       \n+#+     +:+    +#+   +#+       +#++:++#  \n +#+   +#+     +#+   +#+       +#+       \n  #+#+#+#      #+#   #+#    #+##+#       \n    ###    ################### ##########\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:739eefa00fda3d5f116492cdfeb3f9887903c714","amp;dn":"A+Very+Harold+And+Kumar+Christmas+2011+720p+BRRip+x264+vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"739eefa00fda3d5f116492cdfeb3f9887903c714","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,158,239,160,15,218,61,95,17,100,146,205,254,179,249,136,121,3,199,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
