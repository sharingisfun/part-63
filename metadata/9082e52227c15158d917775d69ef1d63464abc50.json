Drawing on fascinating eyewitness accounts and contemporary records, Dr Asbridge constructs an insightful and nuanced picture of these men and their fiercely fought struggle for the Holy Land.\n\nAlmost perfectly matched as adversaries, these two titans of holy war clashed during a year-long campaign that raged across Palestine. Both were willing to commit appalling atrocities in pursuit of victory. Each brought the full force of his military genius, guile and cunning to bear, all in pursuit of the ultimate prize: Jerusalem. Dr Asbridge reveals how this shattering conflict brought Saladin and Richard to their knees, even as it served to forge their legends.\n\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC 2pass [1/3DVD]\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 1280*720\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9082e52227c15158d917775d69ef1d63464abc50","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+The+Crusades+2.+The+Clash+of+Titans+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9082e52227c15158d917775d69ef1d63464abc50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,130,229,34,39,193,81,88,217,23,119,93,105,239,29,99,70,74,188,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
