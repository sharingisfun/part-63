Whether we are trying to run a business, practice a vocation, raise our families, cooperate with our neighbors, or follow our religious beliefs, we run afoul of the governmentâ€”not because we are doing anything wrong but because the government has decided it knows better. When we object, that government can and does tell us, â€œTry to fight this, and weâ€™ll ruin you.â€\r\n\r\nIn this provocative book, acclaimed social scientist and bestselling author Charles Murray shows us why we can no longer hope to roll back the power of the federal government through the normal political process. The Constitution is broken in ways that cannot be fixed even by a sympathetic Supreme Court. Our legal system is increasingly lawless, unmoored from traditional ideas of â€œthe rule of law.â€ The legislative process has become systemically corrupt no matter which party is in control","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:278fa13ee5b3bd9b2fad60232bfa0230fb888ae1","amp;dn":"Charles+Murray+-+By+the+People+-+Rebuilding+Liberty+Without+Perm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"278fa13ee5b3bd9b2fad60232bfa0230fb888ae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,143,161,62,229,179,189,155,47,173,96,35,43,250,2,48,251,136,138,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
