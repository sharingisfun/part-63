Millions of children tune in daily to watch Elmo, yet when Kevin walks down the street he is not recognized. Pivotal to the film is the exploration of Jim HensonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meteoric rise, and KevinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ultimate achievement of his goal to become part of the Henson family of puppeteers. In addition to puppeteering Elmo, Mr. Clash is arguably the creative force behind todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sesame Street, producing, directing and traveling around the globe training other puppeteers. Includes interviews with Frank Oz, Rosie OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donnell, Whoopi Goldberg, Carroll Spinney, Joan Ganz Cooney, Marty Robinson, Fran Brill, and Bill Barretta.\n\nGenre: Documentary\nIMDB rating:8.2/10\nDirected by: Constance Marks, Philip Shane\nStarring: Kevin Clash, Whoopi Goldberg and Frank Oz\n\nRelease Name: Being.Elmo.2011.Screener.MKV-P2P\nSize: 1.18 GB\nVideo: x264, 720ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€480, 2027 kbps , 23.976 fps\nAudio: English , AAC\nRuntime: 1h 16 min\n\n:ONLINE:\nSOON\n\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5acdb346ee15761915801cd5705367daaf9b12","amp;dn":"Being.Elmo.2011.480p.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5acdb346ee15761915801cd5705367daaf9b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,90,205,179,70,238,21,118,25,21,128,28,213,112,83,103,218,175,155,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
