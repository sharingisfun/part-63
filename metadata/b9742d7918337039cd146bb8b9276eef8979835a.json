You can use imported and linked tables and queries from MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft Access and many other data sources, or design your own with Base, to build powerful front-ends with sophisticated forms, reports and views. Support is built-in or easily addable for a very wide range of database products, notably the standardly-provided HSQL, MySQL, Adabas D, Microsoft Access and PostgreSQL.\n\nMath is a simple equation editor that lets you lay-out and display your mathematical, chemical, electrical or scientific equations quickly in standard written notation. Even the most-complex calculations can be understandable when displayed correctly. E=mc2.\n\nLibreOffice also comes configured with a PDF file creator, meaning you can distribute documents that you're sure can be opened and read by users of almost any computing device or operating system.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMacintosh\n\nThe software and hardware prerequisites for installing on a Macintosh computer are as follows:\n\n* MacOSX 10.4 (Tiger) or higher;\n\n* Intel or PowerPC processor;\n\n* 512 Mb RAM;\n\n* Up to 800 Mb available hard disk space;\n\n* 1024x768 graphic device with 256 colors (higher resolution recommended).\n\nFor certain features of the software - but not most - Java is required.\nJava is notably required for Base.\n\n\nIt is a recommended best practice to back-up your system and data before you remove or install software.\n\n\nThis description is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License (CC BY-SA 3.0).
