I merely compiled the files found freely on the internet for someone who wants to do any and all of the above with their phone. Any use of this software or these guides is taken at the user's risk, and I am not responsible for any misuse of any programs, not am I responsible for any damages done by the software, any exploding computers, and damage done by exploding computers, or the damage to your door when the FBI breaks down your door.\n\n==================================\n\n\n\n\nThis is a compilation of all of the fun stuff you can do with your new Verizon Wireless Droid 3. All software included is (as close as I can figure) up to date as of 12/12/2011.\n\n1. Preliminary\n\nThis is all of the stuff that you should install on your computer prior to any of these modifications. It's mostly drivers and .net Frameworks from Microsoft. .net 2.0 will work just fine for any of these mods, but I included the installer for .net 4.0, just in case you want/need it. Note: There is a difference between the x86 and x64 versions of the installer. Only install the one you plan on using.\n\nThe MotoHelper_2.0.49_Driver_5.0.0.exe file is for an x86 filesystem while the Motorola_End_User_Driver_Installation_5.2.0_64bit.msi file is for an x64 system. Again, watch what system you're installing on. I have them both installed, but who knows what damage you could do.\n\n2. Rooting\n\nThis will give you access to the Root user on your phone. Rooting is required for both of the other mods, so I would highly suggest you do this one first. The video provided is NOT me, nor is it a production of mine. It belongs entirely to its owner, Youtube User thedroidpeople .\n\n3. Tethering\n\nWARNING: This has very serious potential to brick your phone. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY CAREFULLY SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE ATTEMPTING. With that being said, I had no problems the first time I went through it. I would suggest you copy down the Data (Hex Only) for each Element ID code somewhere for future reference, in case you want to unmod your radio, but that's just me. Aside from a return to factory or selling the phone, I can't see a reason to ever need to do this. You can do Bootstrapping first if you really want, but this is the order that I did it in.\n\n4. Bootstrapping\n\nWARNING: This one also has the potential to brick your phone if not done correctly, so be careful. That being said, this one is actually pretty easy. All I can say is that I recommend you do complete backups of everything and move said backups to your computer (not just to the SD card) long before you attempt any of these. It's a terrifying prospect to lose everything you have because of one little mistake.\n\n5. Closing\n\nIn closing, all I will say is have fun. These guides will help you make your phone work just the way it was intended: To your specifications, without all of the garbage Verizon has decided to put on there. Good luck, so long, and thanks for all the fish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7548f7ee82f56cbf2bdb14e07225bf3601d3ac71","amp;dn":"Droid+3+Starter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7548f7ee82f56cbf2bdb14e07225bf3601d3ac71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,72,247,238,130,245,108,191,43,219,20,224,114,37,191,54,1,211,172,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
