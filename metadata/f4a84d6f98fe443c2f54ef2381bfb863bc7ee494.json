It was the first film made by the writer-director duo of Mullapudi Venkata Ramana and Bapu.\n\nThe movie also introduced Krishna in a leading role, who would go on to become a major player in Telugu. Vijaya Nirmala was cast beside him who would later marry Krishna. The movie was both a critical and financial success. Also introduced in the movie was Saakshi Ranga Rao, whose name was preceded by the movie's in every other movie he acted subsequently. The movie tells the story of a naive and bucolic young man who is exploited by the society and turns into a hardhearted person. The movie was marked by great performances from Krishna, Vijaya Nirmala and 'Saakshi' Ranga Rao and would stand as a milestone in their long careers.\n\nAbout the film:\n\nBapu's debut is regarded as an 'experimental' movie about rural politics. The villain Fakir (Jagga Rao), a truck driver paid by a local politician, kills two men. A boatman (Krishna) witnesses the murders and the entire village, hoping to get Fakir imprisoned, supports the witness when case comes to the court. However Fakir claims self-defense and gets a light jail sentence. When Fakir comes out, he publicly announces his intentions to kill the boatman. Eventually, the boatman's lover, who is also Fakir's sister (Vijaya Nirmala), kills Fakir.\n\nThe film introduced the unknown pair of Krishna and Vijaya Nirmala acting without make-up in outdoor sequences, a standard aspect of New Indian Cinema realism.\n\n\nSCREEN SHOTS:\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a84d6f98fe443c2f54ef2381bfb863bc7ee494","amp;dn":"Sakshi+%5B1967%5D%2CS.Star+Krishna%2C+Telugu%2C+Flv.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a84d6f98fe443c2f54ef2381bfb863bc7ee494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,168,77,111,152,254,68,60,47,84,239,35,129,191,184,99,188,126,228,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
