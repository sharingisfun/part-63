The IMAX thrill comes mainly from\r\nthe aerial images, with the highlight being the fly-bys over the mountain tops.\r\nInteresting graphics are also shown occasionally to help the viewer map the\r\ngeographic location and layout of the track. The movie included a rather nice\r\nrendering of &quot;500 Miles&quot; (an old Peter, Paul and Mary song).\r\nAlong the journey we're told the history of the construction of the track in the\r\n1880s. This is illustrated by huge close ups of a number of remarkable old\r\nphotographs. We're also shown the locations of other important historical events\r\nconnected with the CPR line. The film succeeds in conveying how the construction\r\nof this railway was an engineering feat and an important event in Canadian history.\r\nThe film also shows how much human endeavour was involved. The only characters in\r\nthis film -- apart from a few shots of the driver and maintainers -- are those in\r\nthe close ups of the old photographs: the silent faces of the men posing in the\r\nwilderness. When blown up to IMAX proportions, those photos take on a life of\r\ntheir own","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b8ba8a5c5a9d8960fe80b63e6faa94dd4ab56a","amp;dn":"Rocky+Mountain+Express+BRip%281080p%29+Hon3y","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b8ba8a5c5a9d8960fe80b63e6faa94dd4ab56a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,184,186,138,92,90,157,137,96,254,128,182,62,111,170,148,221,74,181,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
