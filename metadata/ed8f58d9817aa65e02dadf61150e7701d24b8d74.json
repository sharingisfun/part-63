The quality of the Rogla video is significantly worse than other races. CRF 28 was needed to lower the bitrate. One of the cameras had a 16 pixel black bar down the right side - it's normally an 8 pixel black bar. It's possible they're using low quality SD cameras and elsewhere they're probably using high quality HD cameras.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 678 MB\nRun-Time__: 63 min\nContainer_: MP4\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC High L3.1 832x468 25fps CRF 28 (1363Kbps)\nAudio_____: HE-AAC 128Kbps ABR 2 channels 48KHz\n\nThe link to the torrents can also be found at NordicXplained blog in the Media tab.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed8f58d9817aa65e02dadf61150e7701d24b8d74","amp;dn":"FIS+World+Cup+Cross-Country+%282011-12-18%29+Rogla+Sprint+PDTV+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed8f58d9817aa65e02dadf61150e7701d24b8d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,143,88,217,129,122,166,94,2,218,223,97,21,14,119,1,210,75,141,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
