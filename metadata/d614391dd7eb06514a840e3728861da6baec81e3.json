SendOff uses Endicia for Mac to print labels, and the Zebra printer is supported by Endicia.\n\nKeep track of your order information along with your shipment information.\nAfter your orders are loaded, you can combine multiple orders into a single shipment, or if you need to split an order into separate shipments, SendOff will keep track of which items are in each shipment.\n\nAutosave\nSendOff saves your loaded orders and their postage settings, as well as the print log, regularly so that you won't lose your work.\n\nSendOff is fully integrated with Endicia for Mac\nWhen the shipment information has been set for your orders, click on print. SendOff first shows you your Endicia postage balance (so you can buy more if you need to) and after confirmation, SendOff communicates directly with Endicia for Mac to print your labels. There's no need to export a file and load it into Endicia for Mac yourself (though you CAN do it this way if you want to).\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents                                                                                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1350+ torrents                                                                                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the \\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it\\'s users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt\\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It\\'s an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That\\'s for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet\\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\\'s said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the \\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d614391dd7eb06514a840e3728861da6baec81e3","amp;dn":"SendOff.v1.0.1.MacOSX.Incl.Keymaker-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d614391dd7eb06514a840e3728861da6baec81e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,20,57,29,215,235,6,81,74,132,14,55,40,134,29,166,186,236,129,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
