The player\\'s character, Enoch, starts the game unarmed and  is able to steal weapons from his enemies. The game has three  primary weapons. The first is the Arch, a curved blade which also  allows the user to float for short periods. The second weapon is the  Gale, a ring like weapon that provides a quick dash ability, and the  power to fire small darts in rapid succession. The third weapon is the  Veil, a shield that also acts as a pair of gauntlets, providing the  strongest defense and a strong punch. The Gale is the fastest weapon  of the three, the Veil being the slowest. All of the holy weapons  become weaker and corrupt as they are used, and routinely they have  to be purified. The player performs combos with the rhythmic use of  one button.[2] \n\nPlot\n\nThe story is inspired by the apocryphal Book of Enoch, and follows  Enoch (ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã…Â½ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¯ Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Âªnokku?) (voiced by Blake Ritson[2]), a priest seeking  seven fallen angels to prevent a great flood from destroying  mankind.[3] He is helped in his quest by Lucifel (ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â«ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â·ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â« Rushiferu?)  (voiced by Jason Isaacs[2] in English; Takeuchi Ryota in Japanese), a  guardian angel in charge of the protection of the world who exists  outside of the flow of time, and by four Archangels: Raphael (ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â«  Rafaeru?), Uriel (ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚ÂªÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â« Urieru?), Gabriel (ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚ÂªÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â« Gaburieru?), and  Michael (ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã…Â¸ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â«ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â« Mikaeru?).[3]\n\nDevelopment\n\nEl Shaddai began development in 2007 and was formerly known as  Angelic: Ascension of the Metatron. A work in progress trailer  featured different designs of the characters.[4]\n\nThe game\\'s aesthetic is anime-styled, loosely drawing on sources  such as Studio Ghibli.[5]\n\nEl Shaddai was promoted with a trailer shown at the 2010 E3 press  conference, as well as the Tokyo Game Show. It was met with strong  feedback, which has been attributed to a line of dialogue spoken by  Lucifel to Enoch: \\&quot;You sure that\\'s enough armor?\\&quot;. This quote earned  first place of the Net Buzzword Awards 2010 Grand Prix in Japan.  Despite the trend being the creator\\'s intention, it exceeded their  expectations.[6] Other than the game\\'s promotional movies, pre- release merchandise such as Edwin jeans and action figures were  available for sale.[2] Bandai also produced several figures of the  game\\'s protagonist, which were featured in a Tamashii Features event  in Akihabara, Osaka and Taipei.[7]\n\nAggregate scores\n\nAggregator \tScore\nGameRankings \t79% (PS3)[8]\n77% (X360)[9]\nGameStats \t8.0 / 10[10]\nReview scores\nPublication \tScore\n1UP.com \tB[10]\nEdge \t8/10[9]\nEurogamer \t9/10[10]\nGame Informer \t9/10[10]\nGamePro \t4.5/5 stars\nGameSpot \t8/10[10]\nGamesRadar \t8/10[10]\nGameTrailers \t8.6/10[10]\nGameZone \t8.5/10[10]\nIGN \t5/10\nOfficial PlayStation Magazine (US) \t9/10[8]\nOfficial PlayStation Magazine (UK) \t8/10[8]\nOfficial PlayStation Magazine (Australia) \t8/10[8]\nOfficial Xbox Magazine \t7.5/10\nX-Play \t3/5\nJoystiq \t4.5/5 stars[8]\nDestructoid \t8/10[8]\nPlanet Xbox 360 \t8.8/10\nSci Fi Magazine \tA+\nAwards\nEntity \tAward\nGameZone \tBest Graphics (Artistic)[11]\n1UP.com \tMost Daring Game (Runner-Up)[12]\n\nThe game was met with positive reviews and critical reception.
