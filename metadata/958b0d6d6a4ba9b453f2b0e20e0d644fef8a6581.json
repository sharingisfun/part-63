It promises to help answer questions like why we exist and is a vital part of a Grand Unified Theory of nature. At the heart of the pursuit of the elusive particle is the same feature that makes snowflakes beautiful and human faces attractive: the simple and enchanting idea of symmetry.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720*400)\nVCodec: XviD 2pass from AVC\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 720*400\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:958b0d6d6a4ba9b453f2b0e20e0d644fef8a6581","amp;dn":"BBC+-+The+Hunt+for+Higgs_+A+Horizon+Special+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"958b0d6d6a4ba9b453f2b0e20e0d644fef8a6581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,139,13,109,106,75,169,180,83,242,176,226,14,13,100,79,239,138,101,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
