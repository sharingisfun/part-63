It provides an accessible overview, which will be used by students as a reference throughout their degree, on all issues from research design to presentation. A unique feature of the book is that it provides definitions of terms from both human geography and physical geography  especially relevant now that environment is so critical to our understanding of geography. \n\nOrganized into four parts: Getting Started in Geographical Research  Data Collection in Human Geography  Data Collection in Physical Geography  Analysing and Representing Geographical Data - each chapter comprises: \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ a short definition \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ a summary of the principal arguments \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ a substantive 5,000-word discussion \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ use of real-life examples \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ annotated notes for further reading \n\n The teaching of research methods is integral in all geography courses. Written in an accessible way - by established figures in the discipline - the text provides thorough explanations of key methods and their applications, illustrated with everyday examples. Key Methods in Geography identifies the key analytical and observational strategies with which all UK geography undergraduates must understand to complete their degree.\n\nCONTENTS\nNotes on Contributors ix\nList of Figures xvi\nList of Tables xix\nAcknowledgements xxi\n\nGettinG Started in GeoGraphical reSearch 1\n1 Getting Started in Geographical research:\nhow this book can help 3\nNick Clifford, Shaun French and Gill Valentine\n2 how to conduct a literature Search 16\nMick Healey and Ruth L.
