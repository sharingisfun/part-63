By mid 2004, Beatport started to gain recognition collaborating with some of the top DJs and technology companies in the business such as Native Instruments in Berlin and world-renowned dance artists, Bad Boy Bill, John Acquaviva and Richie Hawtin.\n\nWith the re-vision of the site January 2005, the momentum of Beatport's achievements picked up speed. Beatport 2.0 soon became the recognized global leader in Independent dance music, building a catalog over 100,000 tracks supplied by 2,700 signed labels.\n\nWith the third re-launch, Beatport 3.0 displays significant improvements to the site. Adding to the already impressive list of features, 3.0 includes a more robust search engine, 'My Beatport', 'Users Also Bought' 'Customized weekly emails' 'Enhanced Top 10 lists' and 'Email to a Friend.'\n\nTo help with music discovery, Beatport launched a corresponding community site, Beatportal.com, on May 28, 2007. Beatportal is a result of Beatport's goal to be the most relevant online resource for electronic music. The vision for Beatportal is to provide music lovers with up-to-date information about the world of electronic music. This site offers access to music news, industry news, music reviews, Podcasts, videos, DJ profiles, event listings, nightclubs, and much more.
