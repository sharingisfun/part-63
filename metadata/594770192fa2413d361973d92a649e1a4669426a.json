The only limit is your imagination.\n\nCalc tames your numbers and helps with difficult decisions when you're weighing the alternatives. Analyze your data with Calc and then use it to present your final output. Charts and analysis tools help bring transparency to your conclusions. A fully-integrated help system makes easier work of entering complex formulas. Add data from external databases such as SQL or Oracle, then sort and filter them to produce statistical analyses.\nUse the graphing functions to display large number of 2D and 3D graphics from 13 categories, including line, area, bar, pie, X-Y, and net ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with the dozens of variations available, you're sure to find one that suits your project.\n\nImpress is the fastest and easiest way to create effective multimedia presentations.

Create presentations that look even more professional than the standard presentations you commonly see at work.\nGet your collegues' and bosses' attention by creating something a little bit different.\n\nDraw lets you build diagrams and sketches from scratch.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, so why not try something simple with box and line diagrams? Or else go further and easily build dynamic 3D illustrations and special effects. It's as simple or as powerful as you want it to be.\n\nBase is the database front-end of the LibreOffice suite.\nWith Base, you can seamlessly integrate your existing database structures into the other components of LibreOffice, or create an interface to use and administer your data as a stand-alone application. You can use imported and linked tables and queries from MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft Access and many other data sources, or design your own with Base, to build powerful front-ends with sophisticated forms, reports and views. Support is built-in or easily addable for a very wide range of database products, notably the standardly-provided HSQL, MySQL, Adabas D, Microsoft Access and PostgreSQL.\n\nMath is a simple equation editor that lets you lay-out and display your mathematical, chemical, electrical or scientific equations quickly in standard written notation. Even the most-complex calculations can be understandable when displayed correctly. E=mc2.\n\nLibreOffice also comes configured with a PDF file creator, meaning you can distribute documents that you're sure can be opened and read by users of almost any computing device or operating system.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nLinux\n\nAs a general rule, you are recommended to install LibreOffice via the installation methods recommended by your particular Linux distribution (such as the Ubuntu Software Center, in the case of Ubuntu Linux).\nThis is because it is usually the simplest way to obtain an installation that is optimally integrated into your system. Indeed, LibreOffice may well be already installed by default when you originally install your Linux operating system.\n\n\nThe community-supplied LibreOffice installers are provided for users having special needs, and for out-of-the-ordinary cases.\n\n\nSome Linux distributions ship with their own ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ version of LibreOffice, which may have different features from the community-supplied version of LibreOffice. In many cases, you can install the community-supplied LibreOffice alongside a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ version. However, you may prefer to remove the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ version before installing a community-supplied version.\nFor details on how to do that, please consult the user help resources provided by your particular Linux vendor.\n\n\nPlease make sure you have enough free memory in the temporary directory on your system, and please ensure that read, write and run access rights have been granted. Close all other programs before starting the installation process.\n\n\nThe software and hardware prerequisites for installing on Linux are as follows:\n\n* Linux kernel version 2.6.18 or higher;\n\n* glibc2 version 2.5 or higher;\n\n* gtk version 2.10.4 or higher;\n\n* Pentium-compatible PC (Pentium III, Athlon or more-recent system recommended);\n\n* 256Mb RAM (512Mb RAM recommended);\n\n* Up to 1.55Gb available hard disk space;\n\n* X Server with 1024x768 resolution (higher resolution recommended), with at least 256 colors;\n\n* Gnome 2.16 or higher, with the gail 1.8.6 and at-spi 1.7 packages (required for support for assistive technology [AT] tools), or another compatible GUI (such as KDE, among others).\n\n\nFor certain features of the software - but not most - Java is required.\nJava is notably required for Base.\n\n\nIt is a recommended best practice to back-up your system and data before you remove or install software.\n\n\nThis description is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License (CC BY-SA 3.0).
