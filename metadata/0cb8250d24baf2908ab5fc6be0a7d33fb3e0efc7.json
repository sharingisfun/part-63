Finally, Pacifist can examine the kernel extensions installed in your system to let you see what installer installed them, and whether the installer was made by Apple or a third-party.\n\nWhat's New\n\n* Support for Mac OS X 10.7 (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and its packages\n\n* New ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReceipt SearchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feature lets you search through all receipts to\n  determine what package installed a particular file, and then extract that\n  file if the packages can be found. If the appropriate Software Update\n  packages containing the file can be found, they will also be used to\n  make sure the latest possible version is extracted.
