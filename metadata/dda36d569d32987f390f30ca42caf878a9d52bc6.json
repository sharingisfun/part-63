One thing Hans knows for sure, a good groove. Get the groove right and you really have no problems and there aren't any here. No matter how strong your feelings may be about the blues being a music that belongs in its natural black setting, you would have to be a hard man or woman not to be seduced by this. \n   (Little Nemo) \n\n\n\nTracks:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Behind the Sun \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Believe the Devil Took Her Hand \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Bridges \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Dream \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Circles \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Running Home \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Brand New Dawn \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Zambezi \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Moses \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Odyssey \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· People Get Ready \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· What Will the Children Play \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Rain \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Little Girl \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Mbube \n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dda36d569d32987f390f30ca42caf878a9d52bc6","amp;dn":"Hans+Theessink+Band+-+Bridges","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dda36d569d32987f390f30ca42caf878a9d52bc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,163,109,86,157,50,152,127,57,15,48,202,66,202,248,120,169,213,43,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
