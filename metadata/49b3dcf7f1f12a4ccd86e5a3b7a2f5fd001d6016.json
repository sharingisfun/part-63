Unable to turn anyone away from his new appointment, Smallbone is faced with a collection of moral challenges as he balances the needs of genuine believers, people on the streets, and drug addicts, as well with the demands of social climbers using the church to get their children into the best schools.[5]\n\nAdam has an impossibly difficult job being a modern city vicar and his wife, Alex, who has her own career as a solicitor to worry about, provides fantastic support for him as an individual - seeing through his life as a priest, whilst not being involved with his work. He is also supported by lay reader Nigel who believes he should be running the church. In immediate supervision is Archdeacon Robert putting pressure on Adam to increase the congregation and church income.\n\nParishioners include Colin, a heavy drinking, unemployable lost soul who is Adam\\'s most devoted parishioner, and Adoha, well known for her romantic intentions towards the clergy.\n\n\nCredits\nTom Hollander as Adam Smallbone\nOlivia Colman as Alex Smallbone\nSteve Evets as Colin Lambert\nMiles Jupp as Nigel McCall\nSimon McBurney as Archdeacon Robert\nEllen Thomas as Adoha Onyeka\n\n\n\n\nRev - S02 - E01 - Accidental Hero\nRev - S02 - E02 - The Talented Curate\nRev - S02 - E03 - Sleepless Nights\nRev - S02 - E04 - The Beautiful Game\nRev - S02 - E05 - Accounting\nRev - S02 - E06 - Day Of Decisions\nRev - S02 - E07 - Christmas Special\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 28mn 45s\nBit rate                                 : 1 582 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 28mn 45s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 107 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49b3dcf7f1f12a4ccd86e5a3b7a2f5fd001d6016","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Rev+-+Series+02+-+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49b3dcf7f1f12a4ccd86e5a3b7a2f5fd001d6016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,179,220,247,241,241,42,76,205,134,229,163,183,162,245,253,0,29,96,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
