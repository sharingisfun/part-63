The series directly follows the Countdown to Infinite Crisis special, picking up the story where the special left off. While the OMACs look similar to the earlier Jack Kirby creation OMAC, they are quite different, with a different acronym than the original One-Man Army Corps. OMAC originally stood for &quot;Observational Meta-human Activity Construct&quot;, but currently stands for &quot;Omni Mind And Community.&quot;\n\nIn the mini-series, the OMACs are modified humans who work as sleeper agents, a product of the Checkmate organization, now led by Maxwell Lord. They possess the Brother Eye spy satellite built by Batman following his realization, after the events of Identity Crisis, that his fellow Justice Leaguers had wiped his memory some years before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d21cec8a4ecdbb36a067af60cf8eee3c864aa16","amp;dn":"56.The+OMAC+Project","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d21cec8a4ecdbb36a067af60cf8eee3c864aa16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,33,206,200,164,236,219,179,106,6,122,246,12,248,238,227,200,100,170,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
