In 52 BCE Gaul, Caesar's forces lay siege to the barbarian stronghold of Alesia in one of the biggest battles in history, nearby, another barbarian army prepares to attack the Romans from behind, led by the rebel Cammius, who once fought for Rome. Caesar dispatches his greatest general, Caius Rodius, to track through the untamed countryside, and bring back the rebel's head.
