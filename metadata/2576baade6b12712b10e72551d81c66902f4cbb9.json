Sadly, Nigel's\n    mother loses the battle against a chronic illness and his father\n    soon begins to spend more and more time with newly-divorced\n    cleaner Mrs Potter (Helena Bonham Carter). Mrs Potter's cooking\n    proves to be very popular with Mr Slater and the two are quick\n    to embark on a relationship, moving to the countryside despite\n    Nigel's dislike of his father's new partner. As Mr Slater piles\n    on the pounds, becoming more temperamental, Nigel lands himself\n    a job in the local pub hoping to avoid Mrs Potter. \n\n    In a bid to rescue a failing relationship, Nigel must now use\n    his culinary skills to gain his father's affections, forming\n    a fierce rivalry with Mrs Potter.\n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                   \n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1658851/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1658851/&lt;/a&gt;       \n                                                            \n               a r c h i v e s   a r e   f o r e v e r      \n                    (x) ARCHiViST 2011 / ascii: sH!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2576baade6b12712b10e72551d81c66902f4cbb9","amp;dn":"Toast.2010.DVDRip.XviD-ARCHiViST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2576baade6b12712b10e72551d81c66902f4cbb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,118,186,173,230,177,39,18,177,14,114,85,29,129,198,105,2,244,203,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
