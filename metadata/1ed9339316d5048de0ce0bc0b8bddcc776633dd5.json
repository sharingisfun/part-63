So even though Valentine Hart is one of the most breathtaking women he's ever seen, he's keeping his hands off and his eyes open. Or that's what he tells himself.\r\n\r\nThen one of the models is murdered, and the closer Ethan gets to the answers, the closer he finds himself to Valentine--and the hotter the pressure feels. There's more to Val--more to the other girls--than he could have guessed. But one is keeping a secret that could kill them all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ed9339316d5048de0ce0bc0b8bddcc776633dd5","amp;dn":"Kat+Martin-Into+the+Fury+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ed9339316d5048de0ce0bc0b8bddcc776633dd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,217,51,147,22,213,4,141,224,206,11,192,184,189,220,199,118,99,61,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
