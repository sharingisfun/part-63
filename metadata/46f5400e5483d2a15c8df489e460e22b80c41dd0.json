Jetty has been singing, touring, and recording for the past five years. While living in Hawaii for two years, she became inspired and picked up the guitarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and made many friends, which led to her first regular gigs at a place called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDirty Jakes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jetty would play facing the ocean, as she recalls one time a man was so at peace while she was playing he fell asleep in his bar stool. While in Hawaii, she also joined the rap and hip-hop group Soul Chronicle, and toured the Hawaiian Islands, as well as mainland China with them. Her short stint with Soul Chronicle opened up other doors for her to record with other hip-hop groups such as The S.O.G. crew. With her first experiences in the studio under her belt, Jetty left the Independent hip-hop world for a more organic, folk sound.\n\nShe began writing her first album Blackberries (LP 2007) and borrowed the money from her Grandma to get her first album recorded, mastered, and replicated. Her first album opened the door for Jetty to tour Northern Michigan at numerous festivals, and venues:Traverse City Film Festival, The Cherry Festival, and Blissfest to name a few.\n\nOver the past few years she has been honing her craft something she says she ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t naturally talented with,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in numerous concert dates ranging from Fort Worth, to LA, Chicago to Brooklyn.\n\nIn November 2009 she released her Nobody EP, which she recorded in Nashville. Slowly but surely Jetty RaeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice has begun to make ripples in this congested but exciting independent music world. She recently won the JetBlue T5 contest through ourstage.com, in which she was flown to New York and performed at JetBlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new Terminal 5 at JFK.\n\nJetty has also been noticed by MTV.comÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNeedle In The Haystack.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Her song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Love You,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was selected for a free download of the week. They also featured an interview with her in their blog.\n\nJetty has performed in The Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn New York, The Grand Traverse Opera House, DTE Energy Center, Big Ticket Festival, and countless other venues.\n\nShe has opened for Grace Potter &amp; The Nocturnals, Jay Buchanan, Juana Molina, Joey + Rory and many more Ann Arbor Favorites.\n\nJetty\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s next highly anticipated album will be produced and recorded entirely by Jetty. She was inspired to take audio recording classes after becoming dissatisfied with her lack of control in her previous projects. She was inspired by the do-it yourself-ness by the likes of Imogen Heap, and Aimee Mann.\n\nHer influences include Jennifer Knapp, Brandi Carlile, Cat Power, Ray Lamontagne, Lauryn Hill, Patty Griffin, and many more. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been to a Jetty Rae show you can agree to the fact that song-writing is her true forte, but how she marries her words to her voice and melodies is a thing to see. She has power, and restraint in her voiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the ability to pull at your heart strings delicately like in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlink of an Eye.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ On the other hand she also possesses the power to awaken a passion, a fight in all of us when she really belts it. Her hopes are to eventually start a label for independent artists like herselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that will empower artists to start where they are. She is hoping to give them the tools, studio time, experience, and resources they need to succeed in making great art.\n\nHer aims are not to become a millionaire, or well-know, but rather to evoke a changeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that is much more powerful than herself. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t matter if I am playing for ten people, or a thousand peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that one person who is touched, that one person who doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel alone anymore. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the power of music..and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why I do this.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nJetty is always scoping out small venues, open micÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and coffee shops for up and coming talents.
