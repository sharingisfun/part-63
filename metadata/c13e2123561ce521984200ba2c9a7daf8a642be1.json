Ever downloaded something and didn\\'t want your Mac to sleep while the download is running, but go to sleep afterwards? Ever had a lengthy task running (encoding a video, for example) and had to disable idle sleep so your Mac doesn\\'t go to sleep without you wanting it to? Ever wanted a quick way to just be alarmed when your tea is brewed?\n\nShutdown Timer makes these things the easiest tasks in the world. With Shutdown Timer you can set your Mac to automatically sleep, shutdown or alert you after a set period of time and you can also prevent the OS from sleeping before Shutdown Timer ran down. All that in the easiest interface possible.\n\nKey Features:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Easy-to-use interface that\\'s simple and does what it\\'s supposed to. Just set a time and Shutdown Timer automatically starts running - that\\'s it\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Either let your Mac sleep, shutdown or alert you when the timer is finished\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If you use the same settings alot, set a default timer. Just start Shutdown Timer and the default timer will start runing - without any more effort from your side\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If one default timer isn\\'t enough, save your timer to files so you can load them with just one click\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ With a single click, Shutdown Timer prevents the idle sleep of your Mac while it\\'s running, so you can be sure your Mac only sleeps when you want it to.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The interface adjusts to your needs. Drag the timer to the right and the interface automatically expands, so you can set longer periods of time\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo know , learn and get all things come and join here\nLOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT THINGS ARE HERE\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents                                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1350+ torrents                                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the \\\\\\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\\\\&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it\\\\\\'s users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt\\\\\\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It\\\\\\'s an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That\\\\\\'s for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet\\\\\\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\\\\\\'s said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the \\\\\\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\\\\&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c13e2123561ce521984200ba2c9a7daf8a642be1","amp;dn":"Shutdown.Timer.v1.0.1.MacOSX.Retail-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c13e2123561ce521984200ba2c9a7daf8a642be1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,62,33,35,86,28,229,33,152,66,0,186,44,154,125,175,138,100,43,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
