Your files are stored  \n      in the encrypted form on virtual hard drive with password  \n      authentication,    but   when  it  is  requested  by  any  \n      application,  it  gets  decrypted on-the-fly. Conversely,  \n      unencrypted    data    to    be    stored   is  encrypted  \n      instantaneously  and  then  stored. GiliSoft Private Disk  \n      mounts  a  volume  file  to create a &quot;virtual drive&quot; that  \n      appears to applications and users like any other physical  \n      drive.  Any  data that the user attempts to write to this  \n      drive  is  intercepted  by  kernal driver, encrypted, and  \n      written  to  the  volume  file.Attempts to read from this  \n      volume  are  also  intercepted,  and the relevant data is  \n      read  by  kernal  driver from the volume file, decrypted,  \n      and presented to the application trying to read the data.  \n      Dismounting  the &quot;virtual drive&quot; ensures that data cannot  \n      be  read  from  or  written  to  it.  All  data is stored  \n      encrypted  within  the  &quot;container&quot;. As far as windows is  \n      concerned,  there  is  a  'new'  disk  that  has suddenly  \n      appeared.When   the  program  exists  or  the  volume  is  \n      unmounted,  the  file system stays encrypted and there is  \n      absolutely no way anyone can recover/get the data without  \n      the pass phrase.\n\n            INSTALLATION NOTES:\n      1. Unzip, unrar and run setup/install.\n      2.
