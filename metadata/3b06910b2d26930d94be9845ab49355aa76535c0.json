Before heading off to college they spend one last day together in the woods, the one part of town that has always been off limits to them growing up. As they stumble upon what they thought was an abandoned fort only to find the walls dripping in blood and decompressing body parts lying around, they are startled to learn they are now a part of an undercover investigation. After being told to get out of the woods they realize they're trapped, for the Hunters, who call the fort home, never let anyone out alive\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\nFormat : AVI at 1 001 Kbps\nLength : 796 MiB for 1h 51mn 16s 211ms\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 609 Kbps\nAspect : 720 x 398 (1.809) at 23.976 fps\nAudio #0 : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b06910b2d26930d94be9845ab49355aa76535c0","amp;dn":"The+Hunters+2011+Dvdrip+Xvid+EMPIrE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b06910b2d26930d94be9845ab49355aa76535c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,6,145,11,45,38,147,13,148,190,152,69,171,73,53,90,167,101,53,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
