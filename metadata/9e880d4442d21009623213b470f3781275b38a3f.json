It is here, under cover of night, that the fishermen of Taiji engage in an unseen hunt for thousands of dolphins. The nature of the work is so horrifying, a few desperate men will stop at nothing to keep it hidden from the world. But when an elite team of activists, filmmakers and freedivers embark on a covert mission to penetrate the cove, they discover that the shocking atrocities they find there are just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nWhat have YOU done to stop this?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e880d4442d21009623213b470f3781275b38a3f","amp;dn":"The+Cove+%282009%29+Our+Rape+and+Plunder+on+Desplay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e880d4442d21009623213b470f3781275b38a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,136,13,68,66,210,16,9,98,50,19,180,112,243,120,18,117,179,138,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
