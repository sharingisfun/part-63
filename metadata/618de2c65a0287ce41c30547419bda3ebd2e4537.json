Telling the stories of some of these significant lives is the purpose of this book. Within its pages, you'll meet not only the heroes of the Texas Revolution, for example, but also one of the great African American cowboys of the traildriving era (Bose Ikard) and the first woman in Texas elected to statewide office (Annie Webb Blanton). Visiting cemeteries from every era and all regions of the state, Bill Harvey recounts the histories of famous, infamous, and just plain interesting Texans who lie at rest in Texas cemeteries. The book is organized alphabetically by city for easy reference. For each city, Harvey lists one or more cemeteries, giving their location and history, if significant. At the heart of the book are his profiles of the noteworthy people buried in each cemetery. They include not only famous but also lesser-known and even unknown Texans who made important contributions to the state in the arts, sports, business, military service, politics--truly every area of communal life. For those who want to visit these resting places, Harvey also includes tips on finding cemeteries, locating gravesites, and taking good photographs. Spend time with him in the graveyards of Texas, and you'll soon appreciate what fascinating stories the silent stones can tell.\n\n\n# Paperback: 296 pages\n# Publisher: University of Texas Press; 1 edition (February 1, 2003)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0292734662\n# ISBN-13: 978-0292734661","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:618de2c65a0287ce41c30547419bda3ebd2e4537","amp;dn":"Texas+Cemeteries+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"618de2c65a0287ce41c30547419bda3ebd2e4537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,141,226,198,90,2,135,206,65,195,5,71,65,155,218,62,189,46,69,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
