Recently TVrage has also changed all episodes to season 1 so \nI'm reposting on usenet all episodes previously named as season 2 with the \nproper naming to reflect season 1. \n\n*** If anyone also follows the Spike TV series of Auction Hunters They also did the \nsame with what started as season 3 has since been changed back to season 2. These are \nalso being reposted with proper naming ***  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55793af0b596edd6e821970ebbde06414e31ede5","amp;dn":"storage.hunters.s01e16.hdtv.xvid-wrcr.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55793af0b596edd6e821970ebbde06414e31ede5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,121,58,240,181,150,237,214,232,33,151,14,187,222,6,65,78,49,237,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
