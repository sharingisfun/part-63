So vast it is visible from space, the reef is actually built by tiny animals in partnership with microscopic plants. It is a place full of surprises, always changing, responding to the rhythms of weather, tide, sun and moon.\n\nWithin this magical and intensely crowded world this episode reveals how the amazing reef creatures compete and co-operate - from deadly fish-hunting snails to sharks that can walk on land, fighting corals and parrot fish that spin sleeping bags every night.\n\nRemote cameras, cutting edge underwater macro and digital time-lapse photography, have captured many sequences which have never been filmed before, providing completely fresh perspectives on this extraordinary natural wonder.\n\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC in TS\nAudio: AC3 2ch 192Kbps in TS\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1920*1080i to 1280*720p\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d18ed1a38d94d1d6ea1ad510a4ad62417f27ea","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Great+Barrier+Reef+1+-+Nature%5C%27s+miracle+x264+AC3+720p.mk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75d18ed1a38d94d1d6ea1ad510a4ad62417f27ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,209,142,209,163,141,148,209,214,234,26,213,16,164,173,98,65,127,39,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
