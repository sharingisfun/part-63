Among the noteworthy contributors and their works are Stephen Kingâ€™s â€œThe End of the Whole Mess,â€ â€œThe Pedestrianâ€ by Ray Bradbury, and Arthur C. Clarkeâ€™s â€œNo Morning After.â€\r\nThe first-ever apocalyptic fantasy about global warming, â€œThe End of the World,â€ appears here, in translation from Eugene Moutonâ€™s 1872 French-language original. â€œThe Pretence,â€ by Ramsey Campbell, questions the nature and structure of everyday life in the aftermath of a doomsday prediction. In addition, thought-provoking stories by Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Greg Bear, Erica L. Satifka, and others offer an end-of-the-world extravaganza for fans of science fiction, horror, and fantasy.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979ba346b4220c8f2f34078cc2602ae27794b311","amp;dn":"Grave+Predictions+-+Drew+Ford+%28Editor%29+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979ba346b4220c8f2f34078cc2602ae27794b311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,155,163,70,180,34,12,143,47,52,7,140,194,96,42,226,119,148,179,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
