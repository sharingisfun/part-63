But Subir is not certain that marriage is for him, until he meets Uma, while on a visit to see his Durga Mausi. He and Uma are soon married. Upon his return to Bombay, he announces that Uma and he will sing songs together. Noted poet Brajeshwarlal cautions Subir against this, but Subir goes ahead anyway, and soon realizes that Uma has stolen his popularity, and is much more sought for than he himself.\n\nSource: Retail DVD9 Moserbaer\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069671/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069671/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote: Due to limited brandwidth, the torrent will be slow.
