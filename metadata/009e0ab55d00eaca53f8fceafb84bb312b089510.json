However, the band balked at the prospect of listening to approximately 80 hours of accumulated recordings to decide which would make the best album and it was rumoured that the tapes were subsequently burned to prevent bootlegging. \nTwo shows were consequently scheduled, one at the University of Leeds and the other in Hull, for the expressed purpose of recording and releasing a live album. The shows were performed on 14 and 15 February 1970 at Leeds and Hull, respectively, but technical problems with the recordings from the Hull gig ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the bass guitar had not been recorded on some of the songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ made it all the more necessary for the show from the 14th to be released as the album. Regardless of great approval of the Leeds gig by many fans and critics, the band members believed the recordings at Hull sounded better, as the acoustics projected better in the more spacious venue.\nThe album was ranked number 170 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.(2005)\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50 \n2.&quot;I Can't Explain&quot;   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59 \n3.&quot;Fortune Teller&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35 \n4.&quot;Tattoo&quot;   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42 \n5.&quot;Young Man Blues&quot;   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:52 *\n6.&quot;Substitute&quot;   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:07 *\n7.&quot;Happy Jack&quot;   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14 \n8.&quot;I'm a Boy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42 \n9.&quot;A Quick One, While He's Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:41 \n10.&quot;Amazing Journey/Sparks&quot;   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:55\n11.&quot;Summertime Blues&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 *\n12.&quot;Shakin' All Over&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34 *\n13.&quot;My Generation&quot;   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 15:47 *\n14.&quot;Magic Bus&quot;   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:48 *\n\n* Original tracks\n\nThe Who\n\nRoger Daltrey -  harmonica,vocals\nJohn Entwistle -  bass guitae,vocals\nKeith Moon  - drums\nPete Townshend  - guitar,vocals\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009e0ab55d00eaca53f8fceafb84bb312b089510","amp;dn":"The+Who++Live+At+Leeds+%28rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009e0ab55d00eaca53f8fceafb84bb312b089510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,158,10,181,93,0,234,202,83,248,252,234,251,132,187,49,43,8,149,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
