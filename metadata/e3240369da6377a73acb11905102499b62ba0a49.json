There the two are forced to turn an enormous wheel     \n    along with other captives as part of a gold-and-diamonds mining          \n    operation. The underground city's queen, Halis Mosab, takes note of      \n    the handsome, muscular Maciste and chooses him to be her consort if      \n    he can meet such challenges as saving the kidnapped Princess Saliura     \n    from a gigantic ape. Maciste kills the ape and carries Saliura back      \n    to the aboveground world. The white-clad marauders can't follow them     \n    if it means being caught in the sunlight which instantly dissolves       \n    them. Maciste then returns to the underground city to save the other     \n    captives. Meanwhile, high priest Kahab informs his son, Katar, that      \n    their queen is not one of them but, unbeknownst to her, was kidnapped    \n    as a small child from the &quot;world above.&quot; If Katar can marry her,         \n    their children can be &quot;normal&quot; and can live in the world of sunlight.    \n    Katar sees Maciste as his enemy and is pleased when the re-captured      \n    Maciste is now subjected to a test of strength which will not only       \n    kill him but also Bango and another captive named Loth who is in love    \n    with the Princess Saliura.                                               \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
