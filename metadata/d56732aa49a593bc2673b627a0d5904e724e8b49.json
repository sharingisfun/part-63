In the second of a two-part series, Nick shows how hard it is for politicians to raise the taxes needed to pay for all the things we want.\n\nIn a journey that takes him across Britain, Nick asks if the rich should pay more tax and discovers how little most of us understand about our often baffling tax system. He reveals the perils and pitfalls in store for chancellors who try to meddle with the system, and the ingenious methods they use to get us all to fork out more. Former chancellor Alistair Darling tells him: 'Talking about tax and politics is a bit like talking about sex in public. Everyone knows it's around, but they don't like to talk about it too much.'\n\nIn this film, Nick peels back the curtains to reveal the truth about the politics of tax.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nAVC 1080i to x264 720p\nstream: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1400*1080 AVC 1280*720 x264\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56732aa49a593bc2673b627a0d5904e724e8b49","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Your+Money+and+How+They+Spend+It+2+of+2+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56732aa49a593bc2673b627a0d5904e724e8b49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,103,50,170,73,165,147,188,38,115,182,39,160,213,144,78,114,78,139,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
