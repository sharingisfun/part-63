The screenplay is based on Otomo's manga Akira.\n\nThe film depicts a dystopian Neo-Tokyo in 2019. The plot focuses on biker Tetsuo Shima (Nozomu Sasaki) and his psychic powers and the biker gang member Shotaro Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata), who tries to prevent Tetsuo from releasing the dangerous psychic Akira. While most of the character designs and basic settings were adapted from the original 2182-page manga epic, the restructured plot of the movie differs considerably from the print version, pruning much of the last half of the manga. The film became a hugely popular cult film and is widely considered to be a landmark in Japanese animation and filmmaking in general.\n\nNTSC DVD ISO+MDS Layerbreak File (use IMGburn).\n\n-Demuxed NTSC MPEG-2 DVD Video + Audio\n-Ripped AC3 English Streamline Audio from PAL R4 DVD\n-Used Adobe Audtion CS5 + NTSC AC3 JAP Audio + Time Correction to sync audio to NTSC\n\n-16.9 MPEG2 Video: the Original NTSC Video (no changes or compression)\n-2.0 AC3 Stereo Mix: The Original PAL source converted to NTSC\n-5.1 AC3 Surround Mix: Enhanced and upmixed to 5.1 w/ delay and.
