These range from volcanic eruptions or Tsunamis, to a meteor strike and even nuclear war.\n\n5) The story of Atlantis has become ingrained within popular cultures around the globe. The &quot;lost city&quot; has been featured in a host of comics, films, TV programs, and songs, and even has its own LEGO building-blocks series.\n\n6) Troy was once thought of as a mythical city until a city believed to be Troy was found by Heinrich Schliemann in the late 1800s.\n\n7) People using Google Earth thought they spotted the remains of Atlantis off the west coast of Africa, but the series of parallel lines are an artifact of something more modern: the data collection process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Dominic Frisby\n===========================\n\n\nProduced by: Steve Baker\n========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Truth Behind Atlantis\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:44:59\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2408 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    744 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afe598d8acded8b4c8b8eab014f6dcd84c255e92","amp;dn":"The+Truth+Behind+Atlantis-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afe598d8acded8b4c8b8eab014f6dcd84c255e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,229,152,216,172,222,216,180,200,184,234,176,20,246,220,216,76,37,94,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
