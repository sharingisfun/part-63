Besides screen management, it includes hardware-accelerated eyefinity and has extensive hot-key support.\n\nHydraVision was originally developed in late 90s by Appian Graphics[15] for their multi-head display solutions. ATI acquired HydraVision in July 2001 along with Appian's HydraVision team to join its then-new dual-head Radeon 7500 and 8500 series.\n\nCurrently it is an optional component of the Catalyst software suite.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_HydraVision#HydraVision&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_HydraVision#HydraVision&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwww.amd.com\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98a0ad8290e538e3e7a60994ff4209e8743e07d7","amp;dn":"HydraVision+Package+V12-1+x32-x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98a0ad8290e538e3e7a60994ff4209e8743e07d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,160,173,130,144,229,56,227,231,166,9,148,255,66,9,232,116,62,7,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
