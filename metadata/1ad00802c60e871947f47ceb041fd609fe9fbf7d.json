Picture is good, pressed from a clean negative, though not restored or remastered. Still far better than the youtube clips going around that are presently the only other sources of this awesome film.\n\n*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ad00802c60e871947f47ceb041fd609fe9fbf7d","amp;dn":"Kongo+%281932%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ad00802c60e871947f47ceb041fd609fe9fbf7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,208,8,2,198,14,135,25,71,244,124,235,4,31,214,9,254,159,191,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
