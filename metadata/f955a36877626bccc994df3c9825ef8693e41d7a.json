The monograph series Green Energy and Technology serves as a publishing platform for scientific and technological approaches to &quot;green&quot; - i.e. environmentally friendly and sustainable - technologies. While a focus lies on energy and power supply, it also covers &quot;green&quot; solutions in industrial engineering and engineering design. Green Energy and Technology addresses researchers, advanced students, technical consultants as well as decision makers in industries and politics. Hence, the level of presentation spans from instructional to highly technical. **Indexed in Scopus**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f955a36877626bccc994df3c9825ef8693e41d7a","amp;dn":"Green+Energy+and+Technology+%5BUpdated+at+2016.10.15%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f955a36877626bccc994df3c9825ef8693e41d7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,85,163,104,119,98,107,204,201,148,223,60,152,37,239,134,147,228,29,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
