Now scientists are uncovering a bizarre and alien world that lies 4,000 miles beneath our feet, unlike anything we know on the surface. It is a planet buried within the planet we know, where storms rage within a sea of white-hot metal and a giant forest of crystals make up a metal core the size of the Moon.\n\nHorizon follows scientists who are conducting experiments to recreate this core within their own laboratories, with surprising results.\n\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 2 pass from AVC\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 1280*720\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0921bc8c45c7b039c0a8a711e01d54a882c3e4","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+-+Horizon_+The+Core+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0921bc8c45c7b039c0a8a711e01d54a882c3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,9,33,188,140,69,199,176,57,192,168,167,17,224,29,84,168,130,195,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
