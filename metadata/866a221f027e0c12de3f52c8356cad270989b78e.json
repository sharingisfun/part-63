But something goes terribly wrong and he has found himself responsible for the lives of himself and many others in the castle. This is my first decent-ish mod, and I am still fairly new to the script functions in amnesia, so gimme a break, and if you dont like it, then thats not my problem is it. To be honest, no, I didn't test it too much, no, I didn't plan too. If you were REALLY looking forward to this mod, then im sorry to say it might not be as good as you think it is...\n\nDeveloped By Tripication\n\nPlease SEED!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:866a221f027e0c12de3f52c8356cad270989b78e","amp;dn":"Amnesia+Mod+Outskirts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"866a221f027e0c12de3f52c8356cad270989b78e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,106,34,31,2,126,12,18,222,63,82,200,53,108,173,39,9,137,183,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
