(In other words, a DUI? ) For Chelsea Newman, it was in the drunk tank at her local jail.\nAnd maybe &quot;life-changing&quot; is a slight exaggeration - her version of a wake-up call is realizing that the way to avoid driving drunk is to get an apartment within walking distance from work! But hey, baby steps, right? \n\nChelsea is young, strong-willed, and a force of nature determined to live life to the fullest and make no apologies.\nHer friends are along for the ride, but they all know it's Chelsea's way or the highway.\nHer fiery Cuban BFF accuses her of &quot;collecting weirdoes,&quot; but to Chelsea, different types of people - including Todd, (a little person) who always has her back - just make life more interesting.\nInto her posse comes a new roommate who is Chelsea's polar opposite (sheltered, shy, a virgin) so you can probably guess which way the influence will go.\nChelsea works at her local bar (how appropriate!) where her co-workers are just as crazy as she is.\n\nStarring Laura Prepon (That '70s Show) in the title role and based on the outrageous number one best-selling book by Chelsea Handler, this is one prayer that should definitely not be taught in schools. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&amp;id=248813&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&amp;id=248813&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[pre]...............................................\n.
