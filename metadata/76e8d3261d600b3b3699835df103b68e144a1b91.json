Her     \n    father was killed in a car accident, but Jane thinks he has been         \n    killed because he was blackmailed for a picture of his second wife,      \n    Jane's mother in law. In the same Night Club Bernard finds the           \n    blackmailer corpse and Jane near him, but he believes she is             \n    innocent. So Bernard and Jane run away followed by a dwarf, the          \n    blackmailer's men, who believe Bernard killed their boss and of          \n    course, the Police. They believe that Jerome, Jane's brother, can        \n    help them to solve the case. But Jane doesn't know where he is, or so    \n    she says. Corpse after corpse, Bernard will find out the truth. But      \n    will the truth help him?                                                 \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
