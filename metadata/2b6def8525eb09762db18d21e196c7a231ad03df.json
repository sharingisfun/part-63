At the age of 16, Uschi is bored by her job in a photo lab, but soon becomes the &quot;it girl&quot; of Munich's club scene. When she gets to know Rainer Langhans, they move to Berlin and live in &quot;Kommune 1&quot;, the first politically-motivated commune in Germany. While the other occupants claim she isn't political enough, Uschi just wants to have fun, works as fashion model and leads international music stars in temptation.\n\nAudio : German\nSub : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b6def8525eb09762db18d21e196c7a231ad03df","amp;dn":"Das+Wilde+Leben+%2B+Eng+sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b6def8525eb09762db18d21e196c7a231ad03df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,109,239,133,37,235,9,118,45,177,141,33,225,150,199,162,49,173,3,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
