His father was a colonial administrator in the then extant British Empire. By the time he was walking the old colonies were getting their independence, and his family moved back to the UK. He was sent to a Roman Catholic Monastic boarding school, Gilling Castle and then onto Ampleforth College. It was there that he really started to question what life was all about and how much sense the traditions he was being brought up with really made.\n\nIt was while he was working in the City (London) that his delving into every aspect of spirituality, philosophy and psychology came to a head. It was then when he picked up a copy of the Quran and upon reading it he was convinced that it was revelation from God, and thus started his journey into Islam. This was in 1987. Since that time he has been involved in letting others know about Islam.\n\nHe is well known for his efforts at the renowned &quot;Speaker's Corner&quot; in London's Hyde Park. Currently, he is engaged in different activities including media work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:428aa6081073e7c9b08223fff04099871d16d790","amp;dn":"Beauty+and+Wonders+of+Islam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"428aa6081073e7c9b08223fff04099871d16d790","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,138,166,8,16,115,231,201,176,130,35,255,240,64,153,135,29,22,215,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
