However, idioms can be one of the most difficult areas to learn, especially in English. Even the best student's speech will remain a bit stilted without a working knowledge of idioms; indeed, they are the final measure of fluency.\n\nA Boatload of Idioms presents more than a thousand idioms, along with definitions, origin explanations (where known), sample sentences and exercises. Also, a search index is offered as a quick reference tool. This program is aimed at intermediate-to-advanced ESL students as well as native English speakers who want to improve their language abilities. Once idioms are easily understood, speaking English can be a &quot;cake-walk\n\n\n# 274 Pages\n# Publisher: Vocalis Ltd.
