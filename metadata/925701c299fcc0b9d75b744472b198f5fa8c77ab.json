Recommended graphics cards and drivers are flagged with the gold RealView icon.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nAntivirus Software\r\n\r\nSome antivirus software prevents proper installation of SOLIDWORKS. For additional information, see Antivirus.\r\n\r\nCOSMOSM\r\n\r\nYou can no longer install COSMOSM from the DVDs or using the Installation Manager. You must download COSMOSM from the Downloads area of the Web site.\r\n\r\nModifying SOLIDWORKS PDM Server Installations\r\n\r\nTo modify an installation of SOLIDWORKS PDM Server and its components, use Programs and Features from the Windows Control Panel. You cannot modify the installation with SOLIDWORKS Installation Manager (SLDIM), even if that is what you used to install SOLIDWORKS PDM Server.\r\n\r\nTechnical Alerts\r\nWindows 10 Fonts Missing\r\n\r\nSome fonts that shipped in prior versions of Windows have moved into optional features in Windows 10. When upgrading to Windows 10, these fonts may not be installed on your system. If you find that a SOLIDWORKS document uses a font that is no longer installed on your computer, refer to Microsoft Knowledge base article 3083806.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM\r\n\r\nSOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM is now called SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional.

The crosshair-themed sketch tools pointers are no longer used.\r\n\r\nMore Color in Icons\r\n\r\nMore color is used in icons for the default and classic icon sets. Clarity of icons has improved by introducing highlight colors, such as the use of yellow for lightning bolts and pencils, green for open and import arrows, and magenta for selection filters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925701c299fcc0b9d75b744472b198f5fa8c77ab","amp;dn":"SolidWorks+2016+SP4+%28x64%29+Incl+Activator+%26amp%3B+Patch+%7C+Untouched","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925701c299fcc0b9d75b744472b198f5fa8c77ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,87,1,194,153,252,192,185,215,91,116,68,114,177,152,245,250,140,119,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
