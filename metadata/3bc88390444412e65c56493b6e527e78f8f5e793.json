Among the many season 11 contestants appearing on national TV in front of the panel was W.T. Thompson from Appomatox, Virginia.\n\nThompson is 25-years-old and was part of the auditions held in Savannah, Georgia.  For his official &quot;American Idol&quot; audition, he sang the song &quot;Boondocks&quot; by Little Big Town to try to wow the judges.  Reportedly, he quit a job at a federal prison to try to make it big in show business, with &quot;American Idol&quot; part of his plan.\n \nDue to Thompson's appearance, that also meant an appearance for the town of Appomatox, VA, where Wreck Island is.  A report from a Lynchburg News source gave thoughts from Wreck Island District Supervisor, Gary Tanner, who said:\n\n&quot;Him coming from the county, I think, just brings good things to the county, in name recognition, and then maybe people will see that and say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“hey, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a cool place and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to visit there.\n\nIf heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hugely successful and wins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“American Idol,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ I can guarantee heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to bring success to Appomattox.&quot;\n \nThanks to &quot;Idol&quot; judges Randy Jackson and Jennifer Lopez, W.T. Thompson has a shot at bringing success to Appomattox.  The Virginia resident was voted on to the next round of the competition.  Thompson will also be appearing on local ABC affiliate WSET 13 Friday night at 5PM to talk about &quot;Idol&quot; so far.\n \nThe 2012 edition of &quot;American Idol&quot; for season 11 can be seen on January 23, January 25th, 26th, February 1st, 2nd, and 8th for more auditions.  Hollywood rounds will be shown starting on February 9th.  Roanoke viewers can see the episodes on Fox affiliate WFXR via Cox Cable, DISH Network, and DirecTV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bc88390444412e65c56493b6e527e78f8f5e793","amp;dn":"American+Idol.S11E01.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bc88390444412e65c56493b6e527e78f8f5e793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,200,131,144,68,68,18,230,92,86,73,59,110,82,126,120,248,245,231,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
