It was Johnny Mercer and Gene de Paul's followup to their rustic Hollywood hit, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.&quot; Capp's comic strip was already 20 years old but still very popular. The songs are enjoyable and the script's jabs at the government, politicians, bureaucrats and corporate fat cats still gets laughs, proving some things haven't changed much. This film and &quot;Funny Face&quot; were among the final big musicals Paramount produced in the Golden Age of Movie Musicals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed6dcc4b38431d75ca1f1a65e8ed9a811ea5aa6","amp;dn":"Lil+Abner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eed6dcc4b38431d75ca1f1a65e8ed9a811ea5aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,214,220,196,179,132,49,215,92,161,241,166,94,142,217,168,17,234,90,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
