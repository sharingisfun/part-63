They are disk images that you can burn to use in a real Dreamcast, or load in a computer Dreamcast emulator if you so wish, and roms are included.  The disc images are all made by me, except two extras included here because they work, and they were really annoying to find on the net.  (I did not create any of the emulators themselves.)  Among the others, there are two DCStella Atari 2600 emulators (one PAL and one NTSC), one three-disc set of the DreamSNES emulator (NTSC), and three different versions of the NesterDCSE emulator (all NTSC).  All of those images are encoded in the .nrg disc format usable by the Nero Burning Rom disc burning software and others; and the NES emulators also come in the more typical .cdi format for Dreamcast disc images, usable by DiscJuggler.  One (modified) NES emulator also comes in the .iso format for SD cards for use in the Dreamshell operating system.  (It works!!! Play over 3000 Nintendo games at full speed, with no working parts!)  They have all been burned and reburned and tested!  Enjoy! :)\n\n- FluxCapacitor\n\nPS: There are also 7 VMU saves included, which you can copy to the VMU using Dreamshell and an SD card.\n\nPPS:  I tried making .iso files for SD card from the Atari and the DreamSNES discs to no avail!  Any help is appreciated! :)\n\nPPPS:  There were many strange errors on the VMUs and the save files were difficult to retrieve!  The emulator was saving every slot to the same slot, which erased some good save files. :(  Be warned!\n\nPPPPS:  That is not to mention the normal bugginess of the NesterDCSE program, which crashes on saving some games.  You can also load most of these saves in the NesterDC 7.1 emulator (not included).  You can find out more information about NesterDCSE at http://dcemulation.org/?title=NesterDC_SE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1fac240d213b58260c9b874ad93d9d9d2fc3261","amp;dn":"Dreamcast+Emu+Disc+Images+Atari+NES+SNES+Made+by+Fluxcapacitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1fac240d213b58260c9b874ad93d9d9d2fc3261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,250,194,64,210,19,181,130,96,201,184,116,173,147,217,217,210,252,50,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
