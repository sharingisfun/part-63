Becky manages to insinuate herself in   \n Amelia's family and gets to know all their friends.     \n From this possibly auspicious- beginning, she manages   \n to ruin her own life, becoming sick, broke, and lonely, \n and also ruins the lives of many other &quot;loved ones&quot;. In \n the movie we get to see the class distinctions in       \n England at the time, and get a sense of what it was     \n like for the English military at the time of the        \n Napoleonic wars.                                        \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n          Miriam Hopkins  \t ... \tBecky Sharp         \n          Frances Dee\t ...\tAmelia Sedley       \n          Cedric Hardwicke\t ...\tMarquis of Steyne   \n          Billie Burke\t ...\tLady Bareacres      \n          Alison Skipworth\t ...\tMiss Crawley        \n          Nigel Bruce\t ...\tJoseph Sedley       \n          Alan Mowbray\t ...\tRawdon Crawley      \n          G.P.
