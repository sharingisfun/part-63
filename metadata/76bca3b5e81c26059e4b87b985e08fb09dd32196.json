On the surface...\n\nReview \n\nOh my God...If you go to church, pick flowers, smile at babies, pet kitties, or generally think people are kind and good, then HEADER is not for you. I left the theater in NYC with a pit in my stomach. I couldn't believe what i saw. what a story! I had to talk to my friends about it the rest of the night just to cope with what I saw. I still tell people about it, which is why i'm here now typing this comment. It's got to be seen. Very original plot. The acting was great, good film-making for an indie. I read a bunch of great reviews on the film too since i saw it, and these reviewers are as excited as i am about it. A desperate ATF officer, drug running, violent hillbillies, a sadistic legless old man in a wheelchair, the brutal act of Headers and a conclusion that surprised me and the gang I was with...It had to be the craziest flick i've ever seen. Edward Lee and Archibald Flancranstin are both going to hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76bca3b5e81c26059e4b87b985e08fb09dd32196","amp;dn":"Header+%282006%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76bca3b5e81c26059e4b87b985e08fb09dd32196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,188,163,181,232,28,38,5,158,75,135,185,133,224,143,176,157,211,33,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
