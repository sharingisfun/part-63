For sisters Liz (Emily Mortimer), Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), that person is their perennially upbeat brother Ned, an organic farmer whose willingness to rely on the honesty of mankind is a less-than-optimum strategy for a tidy, trouble-free existence. Ned may be utterly lacking in common sense, but he is their brother and so, after his girlfriend dumps him and boots him off the farm, his sisters once again come to his rescue. As Liz, Emily and Natalie each take a turn at housing Ned, their brother's unfailing commitment to honesty creates more than a few messes in their comfortable routines. But as each of their lives begins to unravel, Ned's family comes to realize that maybe, in believing and trusting the people around him, Ned isn't such an idiot after all.\n\n\nTitle ______________ Our Idiot Brother\nSource _____________ Blu-ray\nRelease ____________ 01-25-2012\nRipper _____________ Zoo\nRuntime ____________ 01:29:51\nVideo ______________ x264 @ 1,730 Kbps\nAudio ______________ AC3 6CH @ 448 Kbps\nResolution _________ 1024 x 576\nGenre ______________ Comedy | Drama\nLanguage ___________ English\nSubtitle ___________ Spanish\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shareimage.org/images/ou0pafkukx887r9ppzj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shareimage.org/images/ou0pafkukx887r9ppzj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shareimage.org/images/729mhvqzo96k2vg1wam.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shareimage.org/images/729mhvqzo96k2vg1wam.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shareimage.org/images/m1vfzkknbqh1timdpglf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shareimage.org/images/m1vfzkknbqh1timdpglf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shareimage.org/images/8lcnh14hsysr4u5yv7r1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shareimage.org/images/8lcnh14hsysr4u5yv7r1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97551b4e8f334fe904a0069a070283d39efe5dda","amp;dn":"Our.Idiot.Brother.2011.BDRip.x264.AC3-Zoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97551b4e8f334fe904a0069a070283d39efe5dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,85,27,78,143,51,79,233,4,160,6,154,7,2,131,211,158,254,93,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
