But when an investigation in Ohio revealed that babies suffering from a serious lung illness had been exposed to a toxic black mold in their homes, millions of Americans became nervous about patches of mold in their own basements and bathrooms. Before long, lawsuits were filed by the residents of mold-contaminated homes in every state. By failing to address water damage, building contractors, plumbers, and insurance agents were held liable for exposing families to an unprecedented microbiological hazard. The mold crisis soon developed into a fully-fledged media circus. In Carpet Monsters and Killer Spores, Nicholas Money explores the science behind the headlines and courtroom dramas, and profiles the toxin-producing mold that is a common inhabitant of water-damaged buildings. Nicholas Money tells the most important mycological story since potato blight, with his inimitable style of scientific clarity and dark humor.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 200 pages\n# Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA; 1St Edition edition (April 8, 2004)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0195172272\n# ISBN-13: 978-0195172270","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b547987bac3e08dc26e44f04c0756c1abb3d0525","amp;dn":"Carpet+Monsters+and+Killer+Spores%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b547987bac3e08dc26e44f04c0756c1abb3d0525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,71,152,123,172,62,8,220,38,228,79,4,192,117,108,26,187,61,5,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
