The show, which ran to 71 episodes over six series, was originally broadcast by the BBC between 10 January 1986 and 4 December 1994, although there was a five year gap between the first and second series. It was adapted for television by Ian La Frenais.\r\n\r\nThe series concerns the adventures of the eponymous Lovejoy, played by Ian McShane, a roguish antiques dealer based in East Anglia. Within the trade, he has a reputation as a &quot;divvie&quot;, a person with almost unnatural powers for recognising exceptional items as well as distinguishing genuine antiques from fakes or forgeries.\r\n \nhttp://epguides.com/Lovejoy/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df5d9e59068f7581a48a6bfdfcf839e5a7cf4ecc","amp;dn":"Lovejoy+%281986-1994%29+-+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df5d9e59068f7581a48a6bfdfcf839e5a7cf4ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,93,158,89,6,143,117,129,164,138,107,253,252,248,57,229,167,207,78,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
