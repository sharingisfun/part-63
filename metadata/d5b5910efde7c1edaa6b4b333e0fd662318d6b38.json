ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢teau de Noisy - Belgium - Castle\n\nI captured this from analog cable in Asia using my new Hauppauge card and reduced the file size as much as I could. The quality is good considering the source.\n\n\nAnother episode (EP 1) is on youtube in 3 segments.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5b5910efde7c1edaa6b4b333e0fd662318d6b38","amp;dn":"Photoxplorers_EP4_Ch%26Atilde%3B%26cent%3Bteau_de_Noisy_Belgium+_Castle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5b5910efde7c1edaa6b4b333e0fd662318d6b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,181,145,14,253,231,193,237,170,107,75,51,62,15,214,98,49,141,107,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
