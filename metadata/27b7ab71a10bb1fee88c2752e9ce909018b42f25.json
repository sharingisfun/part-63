Ashley Judd shines in this unstoppable, untoppable box-office smash that co-stars Tommy Lee Jones in his best performance since The Fugitive. \n\nJudd plays Libby Parsons, who discovers that the husband she's convicted of murdering staged his own &quot;death&quot; and framed her for the crime.  Released on parole, she skips town to find him - and that puts parole officer Travis Lehman (Jones) on her trail.  Packed with more crowd-pleasing excitement than several movies put together Double Jeopardy delivers lots of action and spine-tingling suspense from start to finish.\n\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nPlease do not hit and run.
