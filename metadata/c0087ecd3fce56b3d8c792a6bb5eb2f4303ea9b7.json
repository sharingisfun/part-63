Then in 1911, the intrepid explorer Hiram Bingham stumbled upon its remains. But while the walls and chambers have been extensively studied in the years since, the purpose of this ancient site remains unclear. Go to the top of the world to unravel the mysteries of this enigmatic place. \n\n\nSee incredible footage of the earliest expeditions to Machu Picchu, and meet the men and women who have dedicated their lives to unearthing its secrets. Wander through the incredible ruins and feel the eerie presence of the past and the timeless secrets that are locked somewhere within. Was it a pleasure palace, an observatory, a fortress or something else entirely? The answers await just below the clouds in LOST CITY OF THE INCAS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Gavin Macfadyen\n============================\n\n\nProduced &amp; written by: Graham Townsley\n======================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Treasure Seekers Lost Cities Of The Inca\nYear.................:    2001\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:52:42\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2129 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    External English\nFile Size:...........:    802 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2001\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024795/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024795/&lt;/a&gt;\n  \n  \n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0087ecd3fce56b3d8c792a6bb5eb2f4303ea9b7","amp;dn":"Treasure+Seekers+Lost+Cities+Of+The+Inca-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0087ecd3fce56b3d8c792a6bb5eb2f4303ea9b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,8,126,205,63,206,86,179,216,199,146,166,187,94,178,244,48,62,169,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
