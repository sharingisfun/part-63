When first noticed in 2000, they were 75. Now, their population \nhas dwindled down to mere 59.\n\nBecause of their nomadic lifestyle, characterized by their disinterest in \nfarming and loving to live in temporary fences in deep forest in solitude, \nthey are literally heralded as \\\\\\&quot;The Human Apes\\\\\\&quot;.\n\nThe UN, UNESCO and the government of Nepal recognized this group as the \nmost vulnerable among the 57 endangered ethnicities in Nepal, yet little \nhas been done to preserve and sustain this ethnic group and their \ncivilization.\n\nIt took a decade of research to make this documentary. Due to the armed \nconflict and volatile political situation in Nepal, it is made with the \nresources collected and research carried out from 2000 to 2009.\n\nTechnical Note: The entire movie is completely made with free and open \nsource softwares including the operating system. Technical aspects \nincluding the Ken Burns effect and Foley audio were meticulously handled \nby three youngsters, aged 17 15 and 11 during summer vacation in 2009.\n\nCopyright 2000 - 2012 Human Development Institute (http://thehumanape.org/)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523b23e6b2670812efa95ee384822839d1c2be24","amp;dn":"The+Human+Ape%3A+On+the+Verge+of+Extinction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523b23e6b2670812efa95ee384822839d1c2be24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,59,35,230,178,103,8,18,239,169,94,227,132,130,40,57,209,194,190,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
