However, the film was composed (the action was drawn) so that it could be matted/cropped for a 16:9 widescreen presentation. When this film was released for a second time on DVD (as the \\&quot;Original, Uncut Version,\\&quot; in 2002) it was presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. This encode preserves that 16:9 presentation by cropping the 1440x960 image to 1440x810, then resizing to 1280x720.\n\nI\\'m a film snob - well, as much a grown man who still watches \\'cartoons\\' can be  :D - and I would never simply crop a film if that wasn\\'t the creators\\' intent. (You can scour the web for info about the intended aspect ratio of this film). \n\nScreenshots to demonstrate the framing:\n* http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/8439/bbrotj1.png\n* http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/1221/bbrotj2.png\n* http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/1071/bbrotj3.png\n* http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/5455/bbrotj4.png\n* http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/964/bbrotj5.png\n\nAll that said, this is my first torrent upload here and I wanted to keep it smallish &amp; simple. If I get the hang of this, I *might* upload a non-cropped 1080p file for those interested.\n\nI realize this film is 10+ years old but I haven\\'t come across an HD version on torrents and, since the BD is horrid 4:3, I wanted to share a 16:9 version.\n\nPLAYBACK:\nI\\'m an Apple fanboy and this was encoded and tagged for import into iTunes. It will also play on any iDevice - including both versions of the AppleTV - that can do HD. \n\nIf you\\'ve got another device that can do AVC/h.264 encoded video but doesn\\'t like the .m4v extension, you should be able to remux the streams into a more appropriate container (MP4, MKV) without the need to re-encode.\n\nFile extension: m4v\nVido codec: x264\nProfile: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e0a8898788a0d3ced1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nBitrate: ~1800 Kbps\nFrame Size: 1280x720\nFPS: 23.976\n\nAudio 1: English\nCodec: AAC Dolby Pro Logic II\nBitrate: 160 Kbps\n\nAudio 2: English\nCodec: Dolby Digital 5.1\nBitrate: 664 Kbps\n\nAudio 3: English (Creators\\' Commentary)\nCodec: AAC Stereo\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\n\nSoft Subtitle: English SDH","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9372f84e3ce98f6c1eb76956c636190467df8c9f","amp;dn":"Batman+Beyond%3A+Return+of+the+Joker+%282000%29+-+widescreen+720p+for+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9372f84e3ce98f6c1eb76956c636190467df8c9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,114,248,78,60,233,143,108,30,183,105,86,198,54,25,4,103,223,140,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
