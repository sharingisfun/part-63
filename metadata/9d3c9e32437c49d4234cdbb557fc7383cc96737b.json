Note: Future seasons are most likely not returning -- \\\\\\&quot;Sadly, due to the mixed response to Season 1, it\\\\\\'s unlikely we\\\\\\'ll be doing another season of Retro Game Master.\\\\\\&quot; --Joel Johnson wrote on November 19, 2011 at 10:08:05 AM EST through e-mail.\n\nOn January 13th, 2012, Kotaku announced that their agreement to broadcast the show had ended; there will be no second season, and existing episodes will be removed when the rights expire.\n\n\nNote: This is the American Season 1 shown on Kotaku which appears to be compiled from different episodes and seasons of the Japanese airing on Fuji TV. Thus the episode compilation difers from the Fuji TV season 1 airing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Game_Master\n\n\nEpisode list: \n\nRetro Game Master Episode 1: Ninja Gaiden\nRetro Game Master Episode 2: Super Fantasy Zone\nRetro Game Master Episode 3: Bonanza Brothers\nRetro Game Master Episode 4: Solomon\\\\\\'s Key\nRetro Game Master Episode 5: Clock Tower\nRetro Game Master Episode 6: Mighty Bomb Jack\nRetro Game Master Episode 7: The Mystery of Atlantis\nRetro Game Master Episode 8: S.O.S.\nRetro Game Master Episode 9: Battle Golfer Yui\nRetro Game Master Episode 10: 53 Stations of the TÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½kaidÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½\nRetro Game Master Episode 11: The Wing of Madoola\nRetro Game Master Episode 12: Golden Axe\n\n\nSource:\n\nThese are a direct site rip off of Kotaku using DownloadHelper\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d3c9e32437c49d4234cdbb557fc7383cc96737b","amp;dn":"Retro+Game+Master+-+Kotaku+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d3c9e32437c49d4234cdbb557fc7383cc96737b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,60,158,50,67,124,73,212,35,76,219,181,87,252,115,131,204,150,115,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
