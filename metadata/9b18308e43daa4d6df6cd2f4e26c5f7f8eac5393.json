Children of different age and nationalities learn to live together in one house ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a Russian boy, Uzbek, Jew, Lithuanian girl, Tatar, Kazakh and others. Evey child gets to the Makamov family accidentally but stays there by the good will of the foster parents, who understand that it would be better for the kids to stay at their house rather than at the orphanage during those difficult years. The film has wonderfully combined the ideas of patriotism, internationalism and expression of the national mentality of Uzbek people.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard01-9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard01-9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard04-8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard04-8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard05-7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard05-7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----my rip-----\n\n\n\n~~~~~~ Ty ne sirota.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,117,249,536                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:15:25                \n\nFrame Count:....................................113105             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1837                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.239&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2  \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\nMelis Ubukeyev - Belye gory AKA White Mountains (1964)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2144017/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2144017/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis film from Kyrghyztan belongs to an edition of ten films from Central Asia that were shot both during the Soviet times and during the independence epoch. This collection contains 2 films of each country. During the Soviet time, the film makers could show the world the essence of their nation only in a short period of &quot;Thaw&quot;, from 1962 to 1972.\n\nThe film tells of the tragic events in the aftermath of the Kyrgyz popular revolt of 1916. &quot;White Mountains&quot; was the first film to express the spirit of the nation, its wisdom, strength and perseverance during hard times. The image of the Blind Mother (actress Baken Kydykeeva) who takes up the burden of all the hardships that befall her is a metaphor for the miserable Motherland - a noble blind woman, who lost her sight mourning her dead husband and son. Only one daughter remains with her - Uldzhan - and to make her happy, the Blind Mother agrees to her journey to the city with the young man Mukash. Mukash's devotion overcomes all the trials and tribulations that haunt the two young people. The film was awarded the First Prize at the1965 Almaty Film Festival of Central Asian Republics. The distribution title of the film was &quot;Hard Passage&quot;. It was selected by Kyrgyz cinematographers and film critics for the collection of the Central Asian Cinema compiled by OSI, Budapest and the Center of Central Asian Cinematography in 2006 in order to save the first work of the national cinematography, renowned for its outstanding artistic qualities.\n\n~~~~~~ Belyie gory.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................936,617,984                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:03:13                \n\nFrame Count:....................................94802             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1838                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.239&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2    \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nShaken Aimanov - Zemlya Ottsov AKA The Land of The Fathers (1966)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170835/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170835/&lt;/a&gt;   \n\nThis film from Kazakhstan belongs to an edition of ten films from Central Asia that were shot both during the Soviet times and during the independence epoch. This collection contains 2 films of each country. During the Soviet time, the film makers could show the world the essence of their nation only in a short period of &quot;Thaw&quot;, from 1962 to 1972.\n\nThe Land of Our Fathers is one of the outstanding Kazakh films of the Soviet epoch. Since it was shot during the Thaw, the director was able to portray truly national characters and their resistance to the Soviet ideology. This was indeed a bold decision on the part of the director, considering the possible repercussions. Alongside with the references to Muslim customs and the typical Kazakh landscape, the film encapsulates the ethical codes reaffirming the meaning of the Kazakh worldview and values.\n\nAn old man decides to find the body of his son, a Kazakh soldier who died fighting somewhere in Russia, to bury him in the land of his ancestors. Travelling across the land with his grandson, they discover the harsh reality of war. And when they finally find the coveted grave, they realise that many brothers-in-arms are buried with the soldier. Every inch of the great homeland becomes the land of our fathers, the land of the ancestors...\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBoris Kimyagarov - A Time for Peace AKA Hasan Arbakesh (1965)\n\n\nHassan-arbakesh (Tajikistan, 1965) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a uniquely creative attempt to tell about the world of traditional culture of Tajiks, being destroyed by the new Soviet power. Director is Boris Kimyagarov (1920-1979, born in Samarkand to Bukharan Jewish family as Bension Arievich Kimyagarov), one of the founders of Tajik cinematography, one of those who awakened the national self-consciousness in Tajiks. It was shot in 1965, during the period of the so-called Thaw. The main topic of the film is the clash of two cultures, two worlds. The narration in the film is built according to traditional mythological and epic schemes. Unlike other movies of Kimyagarov, this one, because of the communist censorship, was left unknown to the wide audience outside Tajikistan.\n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
