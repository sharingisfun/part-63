White storks leave Africa and struggle to reach Istanbul, the gateway to Europe, while cranes take an easier route over the monkey-guarded Rock of Gibraltar.\n\nIn France, the white horses of the Camargue make a splash around the new arrivals. In Rome, the heat of the city lures 20 million starlings that perform nature's greatest aerial display to outwit peregrines. In Hungary, sand martins grab mayflies from the air; and at Bass Rock, gannets create Britain's greatest natural spectacle as they dive in exquisite slow-motion.\n\nThe story takes an emotional turn as storks and swallows wait for their partners to return and indulge in a spot of DIY to impress. Finally, geese touch down in Svalbard to raise a family. To protect their young, a squadron of birds assemble to see off polar bears.\n\nWith views of birds flying over the Loire Valley, London docklands and the bulb fieds of Holland, this is Europe as never before.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nAVC 1440*1080i to 2pass x264 720p (1/2 DVD)\nAC3 stream copy\n\nAnother perfect encoding.\n\nPls help seed to keep alive!\n\nEnjoy\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d48a85884414b8b6f519b877aa1a9c67eb836f7","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Earthflight+-+Europe+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d48a85884414b8b6f519b877aa1a9c67eb836f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,72,168,88,132,65,75,139,111,81,155,135,122,161,169,198,126,184,54,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
