When they are forcefully parted, the film follows the extraordinary journey of the horse as he moves through the war, changing and inspiring the lives of all those he meets-British cavalry, German soldiers, and a French farmer and his granddaughter-before the story reaches its emotional climax in the heart of No ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Land. The First World War is experienced through the journey of this horse-an odyssey of joy and sorrow, passionate friendship and high adventure.\n\nGenre: Drama | War\nIMDB rating: 7.6/10 (4,722 users)\nDirected by: Steven Spielberg\nStarring: Jeremy Irvine, Emily Watson and David Thewlis\n\nRelease Name: War.Horse.2011.DVDSCR.XVID.Une-CM8\nSize: 701 MiB\nVideo: XViD | 576ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€240 | 538 Kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 118 Kbps\nRuntime: 2h 26mn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3ab7a50afedee6235e4d9b020dc421019f4484b","amp;dn":"War.Horse.2011.DVDSCR.XVID.Une-CM8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3ab7a50afedee6235e4d9b020dc421019f4484b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,171,122,80,175,237,238,98,53,228,217,176,32,220,66,16,25,244,72,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
