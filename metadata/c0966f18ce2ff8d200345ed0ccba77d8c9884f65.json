(This latter follows the death of Stephanie Brown, as well as having been photographed carrying a young girl, shot during the War Games arc, from a school. The girl died soon after.)\n\nAs Batman attempted to deal with his guilt for the death of his friends Spoiler and Orpheus, he discovered another betrayal that fundamentally altered his relationship with one of his oldest, and most respected, friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0966f18ce2ff8d200345ed0ccba77d8c9884f65","amp;dn":"62.War+Crimes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0966f18ce2ff8d200345ed0ccba77d8c9884f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,150,111,24,206,47,248,210,0,52,94,208,204,186,119,216,201,136,79,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
