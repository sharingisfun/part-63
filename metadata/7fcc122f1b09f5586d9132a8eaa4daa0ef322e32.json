It was initially broadcast on radio from 1935 to 1953, and later on television from 1952 to 1957. Originally on CBS, then later changing to NBC, the series pioneered the use of anthology drama for company audio advertising. The Cavalcade of America documented historical events using stories of individual courage, initiative and achievement, often with feel-good dramatizations of the human spirit's triumph against all odds. This was consistent with Du Pont's overall conservative philosophy and legacy as an American company dating back to 1802. The company's motto, &quot;Maker of better things for better living through chemistry,&quot; was read at the beginning of each program, and the dramas emphasized humanitarian progress, particularly improvements in the lives of women, often through technological innovation.\n\nMartin Grams, Jr. is the author of the highly-acclaimed publication, &quot;The History of the Cavalcade of America&quot;, the authorized guide to the history of the popular radio/television series. The 500 page book is available from all major bookstores, including Amazon.com and Borders.com. This book comes highly recommended. It served as an invaluable resource with determining correct titles of episodes. It features an extensive episode guide. Each episode has the names of the radio actors, which allowed, in the case of repeated shows, one production to be distinguished from another.\n\nTerry Salomonson provides valuable information at his website, http://www.audio-classics.com, and list the Broadcast history, air dates, Directors, Producers, Writers, Music Director, Commercial Spokesperson, Announcers, Host, ratings, and a log.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOTRR Certification Information:\n\nSeries Name: Cavalcade of America\nCertification Status: OTRR Certified Accurate\nCertification Date: January 30, 2010\nCertification Version: Version 1\nNumber of CDs: 14\n\n\n\nOLD TIME RADIO RESEARCHERS GROUP\n\n\n\nThis is a production of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group located at Old Time Radio Researchers Website (http://www.otrr.org) and the Old Time Radio Researchers Group\n\nIt contains the most complete and accurate version of this series in the best sound possible at the time of creation.
