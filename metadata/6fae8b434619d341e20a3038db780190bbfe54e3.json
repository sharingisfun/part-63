Miller/OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Neill/Hyde Prealgebra will introduce algebraic concepts early and repeat them as student would work through a Basic College Mathematics (or arithmetic) table of contents. Prealegbra is the ground work thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s needed for developmental students to take the next step into a traditional algebra course.\n\nAccording to our market Julie and MollyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest strength is the ability to conceptualize algebraic concepts. The goal of this textbook will be to help student conceptualize the mathematics and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relevancy in everything from their daily errands to the workplace.\n\nPrealgebra can be considered a derivative of Basic College Mathematics. One new chapter introducing the variable and equations is needed. Each subsequent chapter is basic mathematics/arithmetic content with additional sections containing algebra incorporated throughout.\n\n\n# Paperback: 896 pages\n# Publisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 1 edition (January 8, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0077349954\n# ISBN-13: 978-0077349950","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fae8b434619d341e20a3038db780190bbfe54e3","amp;dn":"Prealgebra%2CJ.Miller+.1st+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fae8b434619d341e20a3038db780190bbfe54e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,174,139,67,70,25,211,65,226,10,48,56,219,120,1,144,187,254,84,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
