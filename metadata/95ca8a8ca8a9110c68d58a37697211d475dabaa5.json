This specific one has no entry.\n\n\nFilmed with high-definition photography, this fascinating documentary sheds light on the history of the famed Great Wall of China, a man-made wall of stone stretching some 4,000 miles. Segments dissect the technological feats surrounding the wall's remarkable construction and also examine the various myths and legends about one of the world's greatest wonders.\n\n\nThe Great Wall of China is a series of stone and earthen fortifications in northern China, built originally to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire against intrusions by various nomadic groups. Several walls have been built since the 5th century BC that are referred to collectively as the Great Wall, which has been rebuilt and maintained from the 5th century BC through the 16th century. One of the most famous is the wall built between 220ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“206 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. Little of that wall remains; the majority of the existing wall was built during the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe Great Wall stretches from Shanhaiguan in the east, to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. The most comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that all the walls measure 8,851.8 km (5,500.3 mi). This is made up of 6,259.6 km (3,889.5 mi) sections of actual wall, 359.7 km (223.5 mi) of trenches and 2,232.5 km (1,387.2 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers\n\nVisibility from low earth orbit\n\nA more controversial question is whether the Wall is visible from low earth orbit (an altitude of as little as 100 miles (160 km)). NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects.[34] Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of photoreceptors on the retina, it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95ca8a8ca8a9110c68d58a37697211d475dabaa5","amp;dn":"China%5C%27s+Great+Wall+%282007%29+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95ca8a8ca8a9110c68d58a37697211d475dabaa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,202,138,140,168,169,17,12,104,213,138,55,105,114,17,212,117,218,186,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
