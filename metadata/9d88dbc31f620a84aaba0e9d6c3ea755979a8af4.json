This tool acts as a proxy between those QuickTime 'buttons' that you find on some websites and the QuickTime Player. It intercepts the URLs and presents you a list of actions to choose from. This tool is also able to extract URLs from .QTL files. Those are found for example on the Yahoo! movie site.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nNOTE:\nPlease seed! After the torrent is done downloading, just leave it running in the background so others could have a chance to get the torrent as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d88dbc31f620a84aaba0e9d6c3ea755979a8af4","amp;dn":"MOV+Download+Tool+1.2.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d88dbc31f620a84aaba0e9d6c3ea755979a8af4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,136,219,195,31,98,10,132,170,186,14,157,108,62,167,85,151,154,138,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
