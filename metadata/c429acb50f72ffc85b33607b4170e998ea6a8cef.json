A\n  better DVD rip of the film is also available here via torrent.\n\n  Please watch The Thief and the Cobbler Recobbled Cut, which restores Williams'\n  original intention as seen in his workprint.\n\n  Williams is the three-time Oscar-winning animation director of Who Framed Roger\n  Rabbit? and A Christmas Carol. The author of the book The Animator's Survival\n  Kit, he is considered one of the greatest living animators.\n\n  He spent 24 years on his masterpiece The Thief and the Cobbler, which was never\n  completed as intended. This terrible Miramax version inserts song numbers, bad\n  voiceovers and generally spits all over Williams' intentions.\n\n  Please watch The Thief and the Cobbler Recobbled Cut, which restores Williams'\n  original intention as seen in his workprint.\n\n  You can see all of Richard Williams' work on a certain Tube video site at\n  the channel thethiefarchive.\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c429acb50f72ffc85b33607b4170e998ea6a8cef","amp;dn":"Thief+and+the+Cobbler+Miramax+WS+Laserdisc+rip+%5BArabian+Knight%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c429acb50f72ffc85b33607b4170e998ea6a8cef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,41,172,181,15,114,255,200,91,51,96,123,65,112,233,152,234,106,140,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
