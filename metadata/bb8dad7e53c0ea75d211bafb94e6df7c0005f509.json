What is x264 \n\n\nx264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!\n\n02. What is a .mkv file \n\n\nMKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard AudioVideo container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8dad7e53c0ea75d211bafb94e6df7c0005f509","amp;dn":"Unstoppable+2010+720p+BRRip+x264%28Hin-5.1+Eng-2.1%29%7ESiNgH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb8dad7e53c0ea75d211bafb94e6df7c0005f509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,141,173,126,83,192,234,117,210,17,186,251,148,230,223,124,0,5,245,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
