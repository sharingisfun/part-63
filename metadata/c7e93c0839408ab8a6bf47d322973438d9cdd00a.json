This documentary   \n  aims to find out. For the first time ever an entire orchestra of 44   \n  instruments will be built from just scrap. The quest to build an      \n  orchestra of instruments out of rubbish is more than just a musical   \n  spectacle - in the construction of these instruments we delve into    \n  the history of instrument making and the science of music, why        \n  different instruments are made the way they are, why some designs     \n  have not changed for hundreds of years and why, when played           \n  together, the sound of an orchestra is unlike anything else on earth. \n                                                                        \n  Inspirational conductor Charles Hazlewood leads the challenge and     \n  charges a group of the UK's top instrument makers with the mission    \n  of transforming junk, broken furniture and the contents of roadside   \n  skips into an orchestra of instruments.                               \n                                                                        \n  The BBC Concert Orchestra - a team of virtuoso performers - will put  \n  their reputations on the line by using these instruments to stage     \n  what they hope will be a flawless performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812   \n  Overture at the 2011 Proms. But will the scrapheap orchestra pass     \n  muster at the mother of all classical musical festivals?              \n                                                                        \n  Enjoy this innovative music instument show!                           \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;097e3d6f6a7b6c7e496e64686065276a6664&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7e93c0839408ab8a6bf47d322973438d9cdd00a","amp;dn":"Scrapheap.Orchestra.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7e93c0839408ab8a6bf47d322973438d9cdd00a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,233,60,8,57,64,138,184,166,191,71,211,34,151,52,56,217,205,208,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
