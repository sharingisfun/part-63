It is a remake of a 1990 film of the same name and is directed by Johar's former assistant Karan Malhotra. Though publicized as a remake; the film borrows only the basic plot of the original, while making the characters and incidents completely different. The title of the film is taken from a poem of the same name called 'Agneepath'[1] which was penned by Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Amitabh's father, and is recited at the beginning of the movie and creates a thematic link that continues through the movie, particularly in the climax, both literally and metaphorically.\nWhile Hrithik Roshan plays the lead role of Vijay Deenanath Chauhan, Sanjay Dutt plays the role of the main antagonist Kancha Cheena, originally played by Amitabh Bachchan and Danny Denzongpa respectively.[2] The film stars Priyanka Chopra as the female lead. Other members of the cast include Rishi Kapoor playing a newly introduced negative character, Om Puri and Zarina Wahab among others.[3][4][5] The award winning character of Krishnan Iyer M.A played by Mithun Chakraborty in the original has been totally done away with. Shooting of the film mostly took place in Diu and Mumbai's film city. Originally slated for release on 20 January, Agneepath was postponed by a week to 26 January 2012, making it a Republic Day release. Upon release, the film broke many box office records and became a critical and commercial success","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a97f245c03b82b73179f9a7253e368ff9293a7","amp;dn":"Agneepath+%282012%29+Hindi+XVideo+Repack+Audio+Clean+Updated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a97f245c03b82b73179f9a7253e368ff9293a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,169,127,36,92,3,184,43,115,23,159,154,114,83,227,104,255,146,147,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
