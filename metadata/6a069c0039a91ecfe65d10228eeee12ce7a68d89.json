An absolute must for every David Essex fan.\nHe is a tremendous talent, absolutely gorgeous to look at and he delivers a powerful, energetic performance of his old hits plus some songs I had never heard before including a dedication to his daughter, Verity. Living in the United States, I have been unable to attend a David Essex concert but have followed his career since 1974. This DVD is a rare treat and a treasure. Includes performances of Here it comes again, The Whisper, Down Again, Me &amp; My Girl Nightclubbing, A song from the London Stage Play of Lord Byron (This is the one dedicated to his daughter), You're so feirce,Rock On, Lamplight, Fishing For The Moon, Second Hand Love, Moonlight Dancing, A Medley of You Don't Know &amp; Twist and Shout, Silver Dream Machine, and On My Bike.\n\n\n\n\ndvd full iso\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
