In religious contexts it is usually a disclosure of something hidden, â€œa vision of heavenly secrets that can make sense of earthly realities&quot;.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the Book of Revelation (Greek: á¼ˆÏ€Î¿ÎºÎ¬Î»Ï…ÏˆÎ¹Ï‚ á¼¸Ï‰Î¬Î½Î½Î¿Ï…, Apokalypsis Ioannou â€“ literally, John's Revelation), the last book of the New Testament, the revelation which John receives is that of the ultimate victory of good over evil and the end of the present age, and that is the primary meaning of the term, one that dates to 1175.[2]\r\n\r\nToday, it is commonly used in reference to any prophetic revelation or so-called end time scenario, or to the end of the world in general.\r\n\r\nSeven trumpets are sounded, one at a time, to cue apocalyptic events that were seen in the vision of the Revelation of Christ Jesus,[1] by John of Patmos,[2] as written in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament. The seven trumpets are sounded by seven angels and the events that follow are described in detail from Revelation Chapters 8 to 11. According to Revelation 8:1-2,[3] the angels sound these trumpets after the breaking of the seventh seal. These seals secured the apocalyptic document, that was in the right hand of Him who sits on the main throne.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25c70b4c87906c53ca4994c9ddfdeb926ae94387","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+170+-+The+Apocalypse+-+7+Trumpets+-+4+Hors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25c70b4c87906c53ca4994c9ddfdeb926ae94387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,199,11,76,135,144,108,83,202,73,148,201,221,253,235,146,106,233,67,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
