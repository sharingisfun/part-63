It premiered on Monday, May 30, 2016 in a new format featuring dancers between ages 8 and 13. The season was broadcast on Fox in the United States, with a show each week on a Monday (as in the previous season). The top prize remained $250,000, and Cat Deeley continued as host.\r\n\r\nAuditions were held in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City. One hundred dancers were selected by the judges for the Dance Academy portion of the season (shown in episodes four and five). Then, ten finalists were selected by, and paired with, &quot;all-stars&quot; from previous seasons, who mentored and sometimes performed with them during the live performance episodes.\r\n\r\nInvader97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a5f4c28339b378d5c534c22317f3b602e841395","amp;dn":"So+You+Think+You+Can+Dance+USA+-+Season+13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a5f4c28339b378d5c534c22317f3b602e841395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,95,76,40,51,155,55,141,92,83,76,34,49,127,59,96,46,132,19,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
