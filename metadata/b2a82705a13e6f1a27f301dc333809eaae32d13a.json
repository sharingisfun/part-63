This week you get to see what news anchors really think of Trump, and analysis of how the Alicia Machado claims are handled.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason the regular uploaders have slowed right down on this site- it's a real shame, I have had to scour all over to find these episodes.\r\n\r\nThe great news is that this week is that an HD version is available - massive thanks to esc &amp; whoever else captured this this. Hopefully future episodes will be shared directly here in this format.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Circus is essential viewing for every voter as it goes behind the spin and actually shines a light on the candidates - and voters should have access to it on a free to air network.\r\n\r\nSadly the show is taking a couple of weeks off, back in 3 weeks time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2a82705a13e6f1a27f301dc333809eaae32d13a","amp;dn":"The+Circus+-+S01E21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2a82705a13e6f1a27f301dc333809eaae32d13a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,168,39,5,161,62,111,26,39,243,1,220,51,56,9,234,174,50,209,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
