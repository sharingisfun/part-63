Your confidential information, including passwords, identities, and credit cards, is kept secure using strong encryption.\n\n1Password fully supports major web browsers, including Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. All browser extensions share the data stored in the keychain which means you never need to manually copy your passwords between browsers or from the password manager to a browser ever again!\n\n1Password has received numerous awards, including 4.5 mice from Macworld magazine, MacLife Editors pick, and was the Pick of Week on MacBreak Weekly by both Leo Laporte and Merlin Mann.\n\n1Password also has a companion iPhone/iPod touch application available in iTunes App Store.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* New: Adding import instructions for Safari, Firefox, and Google\n  Chrome to the File &gt; Import window.\n\n* Changed: Now automatically downloading Login Previews after\n  creating Logins within the Browser Extension.\n\n* Changed: Removed &quot;Do Not Autosave on Domains&quot; list from\n  Preferences as they are now set directly within the browser extension.\n\n* Changed: Disabled smart links while editing secure notes.\n\n* Changed: Export &gt; Text File now includes URL for Generated\n  Passwords.\n\n* Changed: Can now edit tags in Generated Password detail view.\n\n* Fixed: Fixed rare crash caused by invalid data created during Firefox \n  import.\n\n* Fixed: Fixed automatic login into Customer Center and Newsletter\n  signup.\n\n* Fixed: Fixed rare crash in 1Password Helper when unable to write to\n  files due to permissions issues.\n\n* Fixed: Fixed auto-scrolling when finding text in secure notes.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.6 or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a406e27092e92e10468aac28bba14a76b487045b","amp;dn":"1Password+v.+3.8.14+with+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a406e27092e92e10468aac28bba14a76b487045b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,6,226,112,146,233,46,16,70,138,172,40,187,161,74,118,180,135,4,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
