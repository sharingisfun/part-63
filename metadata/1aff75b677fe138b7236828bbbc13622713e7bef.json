It is the fourth film to be released in the Star Wars saga, as the first of a three-part prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as the first film in the saga in terms of story chronology. The Phantom Menace was also Lucas' first product as a film director after 22 years, and only his fourth overall.\n\n\nA 3D re-release has been confirmed, with a release date of February 10, 2012.\n\nThe film follows the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, who escort and protect Queen Amidala in traveling from the planet Naboo to the planet Coruscant in the hope of finding a peaceful end to a large-scale interplanetary trade dispute. The film also features a young Anakin Skywalker before he became a Jedi, introduced as a young slave boy who seems to be unusually strong with nascent powers of The Force, and must contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.\n\n\n\n\nThe Galactic Republic is in a period of decline. In response to a taxation on trade routes, the Trade Federation organizes a blockade of battleships around the planet of Naboo. Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum (Terrence Stamp) dispatches two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Jedi apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson), in hopes of resolving the issue. However, Darth Sidious orders the army to kill the Jedi and invade Naboo with an army of battle droids. The two Jedi escape the attempt on their lives by stowing aboard landing craft and escaping to Naboo. There, Qui-Gon saves Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) from being crushed by a Federation tank. Indebted to the Jedi, Jar Jar leads them to the underwater Gungan city of Otoh Gunga; there, the Jedi unsuccessfully attempt to persuade the Gungans to help the people of Naboo, though they are able to obtain a transport to reach the Capital city of Theed on the surface.\n\nQueen Amidala (Natalie Portman) is captured by the Federation army, but is rescued by the Jedi. The Queen escapes Naboo with the Jedi on her personal starship, which is damaged on its way through the blockade surrounding the planet, forcing them to land on Tatooine, a nearby desert planet, for repairs. Qui-Gon ventures into the settlement of Mos Espa with Jar Jar and the astromech droid R2-D2 to a junk shop to purchase a new hyperdrive generator. The queen allows PadmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, supposedly a handmaid, to journey along with them. There, they meet a slave child named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), an interesting pilot and engineer who has created his own protocol droid, C-3PO. After spending time with Anakin, Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force within the boy, and suspects he may be the &quot;Chosen One&quot; of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force. Qui-Gon makes a bet with Anakin's owner, Watto (Andy Secombe), to enter him in a podracing tournament; if Anakin wins, he will be freed. Anakin manages to win the race and joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, but he is forced to leave his mother Shmi (Pernilla August) behind, as Qui-Gon was unable to arrange for her release. They are attacked by Darth Sidious' apprentice, Darth Maul (Ray Park), who was dispatched to capture the Queen.\n................\n\n\n\n\n\nStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\n\nDirected by George Lucas\nProduced by Rick McCallum\nWritten by George Lucas\nStarring\nLiam Neeson\nEwan McGregor\nNatalie Portman\nJake Lloyd\nIan McDiarmid\nAnthony Daniels\nKenny Baker\nPernilla August\nFrank Oz\nMusic by John Williams\nCinematography David Tattersall\nEditing by Ben Burtt Paul Martin Smith\nStudio Lucasfilm\nDistributed by 20th Century Fox\nRelease date(s) May 19, 1999\nRunning time 133 minutes\n\n\n\nLiam Neeson: Qui-Gon Jinn\nEwan McGregor: Obi-Wan Kenobi\nNatalie Portman: PadmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Amidala\nJake Lloyd: Anakin Skywalker\nPernilla August: Shmi Skywalker\nIan McDiarmid: Palpatine / Darth Sidious\nHugh Quarshie: Capitano Panaka\nAnthony Daniels: C-3PO\nKenny Baker: R2-D2\nSamuel L.
