Whether it's rocketing energy  \n  prices, unexpected bank charges, or a catch in the small print        \n  that's had devastating consequences, they'll get answers from the     \n  companies responsible - as well as giving invaluable tips and advice  \n  on how to get the best deals, and avoid costly rip offs! Plus, the    \n  team have been on the road, tackling consumer complaints face to      \n  face at the Rip Off Britain Pop-Up shop.                              \n                                                                        \n  EPISODE 3                                                             \n                                                                        \n  With house prices so unpredictable, more of you are looking into      \n  ways of extending and improving your current property rather than     \n  trying to move. But trying to find a builder you can trust can be     \n  very tricky. Which? magazine estimated that over the last three       \n  years, 2.5million of us have had some sort of complaint about a       \n  builder. We investigate what happens when a builder doesnt finish a  \n  job, leaving a family out of pocket and frustrated. And one of the    \n  most shocking stories we have heard on Rip Off  a plumber who        \n  charged 14,400 to unblock a drain! We also look at those charges     \n  that can creep up when taking out a mortgage and what you need to be  \n  aware of.                                                             \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;106724767362756750777d71797c3e737f7d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba7697fcfef1ae4067e9a08523fce9ff99b3dd20","amp;dn":"Rip.Off.Britain.S03E03.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba7697fcfef1ae4067e9a08523fce9ff99b3dd20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,118,151,252,254,241,174,64,103,233,160,133,35,252,233,255,153,179,221,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
