That is a span of time so long it can only be measured in theories and equations by scientists pulling all-nighters scribbling on chalkboards. And even then a secretly genius janitor would have to walk in, solve the equation, and confirm, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes, 2004 happened.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Eight years was a long time ago, basically.\n\nSo itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s understandable if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve forgotten that 2004 was a year in which an unassuming indie movie named Napoleon Dynamite made the transition from BYU student film to mainstream pop culture juggernaut. Jared and Jerusha HessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s low-key comedy told the story of a mouth-breathing teenage misfit with an unlikely blaxploitation name and the gaggle of kitschy characters who surrounded him. What began as a highly amusing cult hit ended up an MTV-endorsed, overexposed pop culture annoyance that resulted in frat guys quoting dialogue, Jon Heder receiving additional starring roles, and those ubiquitous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVote For PedroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ t-shirts. In retrospect this over-saturation certainly tarnished the original filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s charms, which is a shame because it was really something special: proudly weird and unpredictable, with a unique sense of humor that worked mostly due to the movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s low-energy, low-budget aesthetic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aeda6aa31d6ffc731fc6c695167570aca31569c","amp;dn":"Napoleon+Dynamite.S01E01.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aeda6aa31d6ffc731fc6c695167570aca31569c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,237,166,170,49,214,255,199,49,252,108,105,81,103,87,10,202,49,86,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
