I acquired these some years ago I can't remember all the performers, though I do know the Clarinet Concerto is performed by Benny Goodman (who commissioned it) with Copland conducting the Columbia Symphony. El Salon and Fanfare are performances. I think, by the Detroit Symphony under Antal Dorati. In any case, they are all very good if not definitive performances of these works.
