Seems to be somewhat of a rare gem for the Xbox 360. So now that I\\\\\\'ve found it, I want to make it available to other strategy/war/rpg fans like me.\n\nIt\\\\\\'s a very good (but tough) Turn Based strategy game. It\\\\\\'s graphics are not up to par with newer games, but it\\\\\\'s got a great story and fantastic strategy elements!\n\nIf you enjoy games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts series, Fire Emblems, X-com, Advance wars, or just a tactical WWII Rpg, you will love this game.\n\nI will be seeding for about 8 hours a day, and a bit longer on weekends.\n\nPlease continue to SEED after download..!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:254cb23dc39e25995c69bba52b8cf6f115b06938","amp;dn":"Operation+Darkness+%28NTSC%2FU%29+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"254cb23dc39e25995c69bba52b8cf6f115b06938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,76,178,61,195,158,37,153,92,105,187,165,43,140,246,241,21,176,105,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
