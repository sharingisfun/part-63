Painkiller: Battle out of Hell picks up where the original left off, with Daniel Garner surrounded by Hell's minions. Although Lucifer has been defeated, you must still fight your way out of Hell with your powerful arsenal, which now includes four new weapons. The single-player campaign features 10 new levels, while the multiplayer portion features new maps and two new modes. The add-on also provides editing and modding tools to create your own multiplayer maps. \nWORK GREAT ON LION 10.7.2\nWine Port\nWith saved game\nUnrar and play app\nENJOY THE GAME","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afe716e525fb1ad1554182b9f944eb31cf45107e","amp;dn":"Painkiller%2BBattle+Out+off+Hell+v1.64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afe716e525fb1ad1554182b9f944eb31cf45107e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,231,22,229,37,251,26,209,85,65,130,185,249,68,235,49,207,69,16,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
