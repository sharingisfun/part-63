During the blues revival of the 80's he was &quot;discovered&quot; and has gone on to inspire a whole new generation of blues musicians. His prolific songwriting and poetic sensibility seem boundless. Pickin' protege Lightnin' Wells and members of the Ministers of Sinister serve as his backup band here. This is Piedmont style country blues at its best.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 Rattlesnakin' Mama  3:41 \n2 Miss Lucy Gray  3:34 \n3 Beautiful City  3:45 \n4 Oh, Red!
