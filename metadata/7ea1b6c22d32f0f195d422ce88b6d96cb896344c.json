Operating their family-run airline, Era Alaska, they battle unforgiving Alaska weather and terrain to transport lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s necessities to one of the most remote and extreme regions of America. With no freeway system for hundreds of miles, Era Alaska is the lifeline for the isolated rural inhabitants of the Bering Sea coastline. From champion snow dogs bound for the Iditarod to medicine for sick children to groceries for miners working on an operation on the North Slope, the goods that the intrepid pilots ship on any given day are crucial to everyday life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea1b6c22d32f0f195d422ce88b6d96cb896344c","amp;dn":"Arctic+Air+S01E03+HDTV+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea1b6c22d32f0f195d422ce88b6d96cb896344c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,161,182,194,45,50,240,241,149,212,34,206,136,182,217,108,184,150,52,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
