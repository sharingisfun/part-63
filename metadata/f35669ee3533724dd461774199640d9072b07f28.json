What did the protest mean, or achieve? The panel will analyze.\n\nAlso, former MTV stars Kennedy and Kurt Loder, the author of a new book on 21st-century movie reviews, dissect the year's culture. We finally got a new take on Ayn Rand's novel in the long-awaited release of the Atlas Shrugged movie. We also got a new &quot;food insecure&quot; Sesame Street muppet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f35669ee3533724dd461774199640d9072b07f28","amp;dn":"20111229-Stossel-%5BLibertarian+Year+in+Review%5D.Fox+Business.CF.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f35669ee3533724dd461774199640d9072b07f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,86,105,238,53,51,114,77,212,97,119,65,153,100,13,144,114,176,127,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
