Ollie (Affleck) is a smooth and successful big-city publicist who has the life he's always wanted -- until things take an unexpected turn and he finds himself an unemployed single father back living with his dad in the suburbs. But just when he thinks his life has hit rock bottom, a sexy, no-nonsense video store clerk (Tyler) enters his life and shows Ollie that sometimes you have to forget who you thought you were and acknowledge what really makes you happy. Also starring Jason Biggs (AMERICAN PIE) -- director Kevin Smith (JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK) has delivered another hit critics are calling one of the year's funniest!
