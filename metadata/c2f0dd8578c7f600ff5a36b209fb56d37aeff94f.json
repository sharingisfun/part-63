It was the first time the race took place outside of Europe and Africa. It has stayed in South America from 2009 to the present (2012). The race is open to amateur and professional entries. Amateurs typically make up about eighty percent of the participants.\n\n\n\nHistory and route\n\nThe race originated in 1978, a year after racer Thierry Sabine got lost in the desert and decided that it would be a good location for a regular rally. Originally, the rally was from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal, interrupted by a transfer across the Mediterranean. However, due to politics and other factors, the course, including origin and destination, has varied over the years. Dakar has been the destination city on all but four occasions during the period the rally was held in Africa (i.e., prior to 2009). The event started from Paris every year from 1979 to 1994, and also in 1998 and 2001. In 1994 the rally both began and ended in Paris but, due to complaints by the mayor, the finish had to be moved from the Champs-ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°lysÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©es to Euro Disney. This also caused the organisation to lay out the rally through different locations in following years.\n\n\nComplete list of routes\n\n    1979ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1980: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    1981ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1988: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“AlgiersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    1989: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“TunisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1991: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“TripoliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    1992: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cape Town\n    1993: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    1994: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“DakarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paris\n    1995ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1996: GranadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    1997: DakarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“AgadezÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    1998: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“GranadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    1999: GranadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    2000: DakarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cairo\n    2001: ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    2002: ArrasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“MadridÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    2003: MarseilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sharm el-Sheikh\n    2004: Clermont-FerrandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    2005: BarcelonaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar\n    2006ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008: LisbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dakar[4]\n    2009: Buenos AiresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ValparaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­soÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Buenos Aires\n    2010: Buenos AiresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“AntofagastaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Buenos Aires\n    2011: Buenos AiresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“AricaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Buenos Aires\n    2012: Mar del PlataÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“CopiapÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lima\n\n\n\nPrevious Editions\n\n\nUntil the 2008 terrorist attacks, more recent rallies passed through Morocco, Western Sahara and on to the grasslands and deserts of Mauritania. The segments running through Atar and the sand dunes and canyons of Mauritania's Adrar Region may be the most challenging in all off-road racing. It was the Mauritania terrorist attacks that led to the demise of the classic Dakar.\n\nIn 1992, Hubert Auriol won the Dakar in an automobile after having previously won the motorcycle competition on two occasions, making him the first driver to win on both two and four wheels. Later on, StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane Peterhansel managed to do the same. In 2001, Jutta Kleinschmidt was the first woman to win the Dakar, driving a Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero, co-driving with fellow German Andreas Schulz.\n\nThe 2008 Dakar Rally was canceled on January 4, 2008 amid fears of terrorist attacks. This caused serious doubts over the future of the rally. Various newspapers in Africa called the cancellation a &quot;death sentence&quot; for the race. Chile and Argentina, in South America, offered their territory to host the event, as well as the Czech Republic, or Hungary in Central Europe. The ASO finally decided to establish the Dakar Series competition, whose first event was the 2008 Central Europe Rally (Hungary-Romania), between April 20 and April 26, 2008. The 2009 event was organised in the two South American countries, between January 3 and January 18, 2009. The competition has stayed in South America from 2009 to present (2012).\n\n\nList of Dakar Rally fatal accidents\n\n\n    1979: Patrick Dodin (Bike)\n    1982: Bert Osterhuis (Bike)\n    1983: Jean-NoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l Pineau (Bike)\n    1986: Giampaolo Marinoni (Bike), Jasuo Kaneko (Bike)\n    1988: Jean-Claude Huger (Bike), Patrick Canado (Car), Kees van Loevezijn (Truck)\n    1991: FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Picquot (Car), Charles Cabannes (Truck), Laurent Le Bourgeois (Car), Jean-Marie Sounillac (Car)\n    1992: Gilles Lalay (Bike)\n    1994: Michel Sansen (Bike)\n    1996: Laurent Gueguen (Truck)\n    1997: Jean-Pierre Leduc (Bike)\n    2002: Daniel Vergnes (Car)\n    2003: Bruno Cauvy (Car)\n    2005: JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Manuel PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rez (Bike), Fabrizio Meoni (Bike)\n    2006: Andy Caldecott (Bike)\n    2007: Elmer Symons (Bike), Eric Aubijoux (Bike)\n    2009: Pascal Terry (Bike)\n    2012: Jorge AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s MartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­nez Boero (Bike)\n\n\n\nCalendar\n\n \nDate  Start                  Finish           KM\n01/01 Mar Del PlataSanta     Rosa de la Pampa 856\n02/01 Santa Rosa de la Pampa San Rafael       781\n03/01 San Rafael             San Juan         563\n04/01 San Juan               Chilecito        714\n05/01 Chilecito              Fiambala         416\n06/01 Fiambala               Copiapo (Deleted) 641\n07/01 Copiapo                Copiapo          598\n08/01 Rest  \n09/01 Copiapo                Antofagasta      686\n10/01 Antofagasta            Iquique          566\n11/01 Iquique                Arica            694\n12/01 Arica                  Arequipa         709\n13/01 Arequipa               Nasca            505\n14/01 Nasca                  Pisco            352\n15/01 Pisco                  Lima             283\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2f0dd8578c7f600ff5a36b209fb56d37aeff94f","amp;dn":"%5BHDTV+720p+x264+ENG%5D+Dakar+2012+Stage06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2f0dd8578c7f600ff5a36b209fb56d37aeff94f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,240,221,133,120,199,246,0,255,90,54,178,9,251,86,211,122,239,249,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
