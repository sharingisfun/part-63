All his classmates treat him with detached contempt, eventually trying to lure him into suicide. His father works nights, and the man can scarcely relate to his son at all, try though he might.\nHodder doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite realize that he misses his mother terribly and that he is desperately, desperately lonely ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ though we can see this all too clearly.\nFortunately for him, his irrepressibly charming innocence enables some people with problems to see that Hodder can be a true friend, in a land and time where true friends are rare and valuable.\nA wonderful film, excellent cinematography, music, and direction. Hodder is so sweet and full of life you just want to hold him and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“make it all betterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, but he does that for himself. Frederik Christian Johansen is nearly perfect in his performance as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“HodderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\n\nSize: 4.57 Gb ( 4 795 454 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nPlay Length: 01:20:46\nVideo: PAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR, Auto Pan&amp;Scan\nAudio: Dansk (Dolby AC3, 2 ch) Dansk (Dolby AC3, 6 ch) Russian (Dolby AC3, 6 ch)\nSubtitles: Dansk, Norsk, English, Russian\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261fa4af762c77fef4ed31334d999eb53aa4844f","amp;dn":"En+Som+Hodder+%282003%29+DVD9+rus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261fa4af762c77fef4ed31334d999eb53aa4844f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,31,164,175,118,44,119,254,244,237,49,51,77,153,158,181,58,164,132,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
