The World War II documentary uses film footage, radio broadcasts, and period music gathered from archives around the world. Interwoven throughout the film are the compelling stories of the Jews of Europe - unforgettable stories of tragedy, courage, resistance, and survival. Liberation begins in 1942, when Adolf Hitler was still at the height of his power and the Allies began envisioning a cross-channel invasion of Europe. The film takes you behind the scenes to illuminate the strategies and deceptions for the combatants on all sides - from America's and Britain's Home Front to wartime London, Moscow, Washington, D.C., and occupied Paris to Berlin. From Churchill to Roosevelt, from Stalin to de Gaulle...Written by Anonymous \n\n\n\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110341/\nGenre: Documentary, History, War\nStarring: Jean Boht, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Hope\nDirector: Arnold Schwartzman\nWriter: Martin Gilbert, Marvin Hier\nRun Time: 1h 39mn\n\nResolution: 512 pixels x 384 pixels\nOverall Bitrate: 972 Kbps\nVideo format: AVI @ 822 Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio 48.0 KHz\nDownload size: 698.24MB\nWriting application: Nandub v1.0rc2\nWriting library: Nandub build 1853/release\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bcfb4e21d71c5910a3321a6bd6ebce90b0c6ca2","amp;dn":"Liberation.1994.DVDRip.XViD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bcfb4e21d71c5910a3321a6bd6ebce90b0c6ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,207,180,226,29,113,197,145,10,51,33,166,189,110,188,233,11,12,108,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
