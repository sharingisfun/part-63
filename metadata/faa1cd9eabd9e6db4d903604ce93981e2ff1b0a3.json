Entries not only address major battles and campaigns, but political, economic, and cultural issues as well, plus brief portraits of the conflict's commanding personalities. Its global perspective notably corrects the usual Western focus of World War II studies, incorporating a wealth of information on often underreported topics such as the Eastern Front and the Sino-Japanese War.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1322 pages\n# Publisher: Greenwood; First Edition edition (April 22, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0313330506\n# ISBN-13: 978-0313330506","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa1cd9eabd9e6db4d903604ce93981e2ff1b0a3","amp;dn":"The+Concise+Encyclopedia+of+World+War+II%282+Vols%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa1cd9eabd9e6db4d903604ce93981e2ff1b0a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,161,205,158,171,217,230,219,77,144,54,4,206,147,152,30,47,241,176,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
