Strafing, which involved the extensive damage of ground, air and naval forces by pilots flying in deadly, low-altitude skies, helped the Allies to their victory. This historical text examines the role of strafing in combat, particularly during World War II, but also during the Korea and Vietnam wars. The nature of gunnery, strafing and gunfighting are explored within the context of particular missions and actions. First-hand accounts and gun camera film evidence contribute to the exploration of this most dangerous form of combat and honor the courage of America's veterans who served as pilots or aerial crewmen.\n\n# Paperback: 271 pages\n# Publisher: McFarland (September 1, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0786448873\n# ISBN-13: 978-0786448876","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5eab5c2d166954deb07f5f09254c92c2c14f591","amp;dn":"Allied+Strafing+in+World+War+II+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5eab5c2d166954deb07f5f09254c92c2c14f591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,234,181,194,209,102,149,77,235,7,245,240,146,84,201,44,44,20,245,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
