It works like dupeGuru, but is specialized for\nduplicate pictures matching. dupeGuru PE runs on Windows, Mac OS X\nand Linux.\n\ndupeGuru PE is efficient. Not only can dupeGuru PE find exact\nmatches, but it can also find duplicates among pictures of\ndifferent kind (PNG, JPG, GIF etc..) and quality. On Mac OS X,\ndupeGuru PE can scan your iPhoto library.\n\ndupeGuru PE is customizable. You can tweak its matching engine to\nfind exactly the kind of duplicates you want to find. The\nPreference page of the help file lists all the scanning engine\nsettings you can change.\n\ndupeGuru PE is safe. Its engine has been especially designed with\nsafety in mind. Its reference directory system as well as its\ngrouping system prevent you from deleting pictures you didn't mean\nto delete.\n\nCompare any picture format. dupeGuru PE supports JPG, PNG, TIFF,\nGIF and BMP formats. All these formats can be compared together.\nThe Mac OS X version of dupeGuru PE also supports PSD and RAW (CR2\nand NEF) formats.\n\nDo whatever you want with your duplicates. Not only can you delete\nduplicates files dupeGuru finds, but you can also move or copy\nthem elsewhere. There are also multiple ways to filter and sort\nyour results to easily weed out false duplicates (for low\nthreshold scans).\n\n..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..\n\nUse our keymaker to register the application.\n\nThanks for choosing\n(C)hallenge (O)f (R)everse (E)ngineering\n\n..: CORE NEWS AND iNFOS :..\n\n- not available -\n\nlAYOUt &amp; hEADER bY. rADs\nnfO UPdATED ON 2012/01/13\n(c) C.O.R.E. 2 0 1 2\n\nCRC 3567:B9EE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72169c73de9906b5661b761e3dffe4006e17de3a","amp;dn":"Hardcoded.Software.dupeGuru.Picture.Edition.v2.4.1.MacOSX.Incl.K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72169c73de9906b5661b761e3dffe4006e17de3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,22,156,115,222,153,6,181,102,27,118,30,61,255,228,0,110,23,222,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
