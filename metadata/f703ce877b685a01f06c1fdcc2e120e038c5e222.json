When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, &quot;the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me.&quot;\n\nAfter Rama's departure, king Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away.\n\nMeanwhile, Bharata who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. \n\nBharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. \n\nHe requests Rama to return and rule. \n\nBut Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile. \n\nHowever, Bharata carries Rama's sandals, and keeps them on the throne, while he rules as Rama's regent.\n\n\n\nI WILL POST ALL THE KANDAS ONE BY ONE...\n\nPLZ SEED THIS DIVINE TORRENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE..\n\nYOU WILL BE ONE OF THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO SPREAD THE MESSAGE OF RAMAYANA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD...\n\nTHIS TORRENT IS NOT RESTRICTED TO HINDUS ONLY...\n\nANY ONE CAN SPREAD GOOD MESSAGE IF THEY HAVE NICE, PEACEFUL HEART..\n\nPLZ SEED GUYZ...\n\nTHANK YOU..\n\n\nPLZ SEED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE..I AM LACKING SEEDS...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f703ce877b685a01f06c1fdcc2e120e038c5e222","amp;dn":"Shrimad+Valmiki+Ramayana+-+Ayodhya+Kanda%28Uttarardh%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f703ce877b685a01f06c1fdcc2e120e038c5e222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,3,206,135,123,104,90,1,240,108,31,220,194,225,32,224,56,197,226,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
