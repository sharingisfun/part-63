The event concludes with a violent and overtly bloody shootout that would generally mark the finale of a movie. This is correct in that it marks the finale of an era, for the characters and the world they live in. They simply can no longer keep up, the times are changing, technology advancing, and they're style of life is getting left behind in the dust that they spent so long galloping through. They abandon their careers for the simpler life of retirement. They enjoy this time, they live their fantasies. During this time the law is always on their tracks, bounty hunters. The further into their fantasy they get, the closer their demise seems to get. When one of their own is captured they are faced with the choice of escape or what is certainly a suicide mission to attempt and free their fallen behind comrade.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065214/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065214/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e65dfaca417fbadf66d258d809ab301a1ccba5","amp;dn":"The+Wild+Bunch+%281969%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e65dfaca417fbadf66d258d809ab301a1ccba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,230,93,250,202,65,127,186,223,102,210,88,216,9,171,48,26,28,203,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
