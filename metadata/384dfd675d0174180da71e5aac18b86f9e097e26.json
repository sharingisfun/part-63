Too many sexual demands? Neglect? Boredom?...     \n    We are concerned in this film with those couples who became restless     \n    and unhappy and still stay married....We are concerned with those who    \n    remain married and live in a half world of illicit sex practices....     \n    For them, wife-swapping, sexual indulgences of all sorts, group          \n    games, and social intercourse that overwhelms the imagination is         \n    common practice.... Then the beautiful gift of Holy Matrimony becomes    \n    Unholy Matrimony!'                                                       \n                                                                             \n    After editor Jim Bremmer gets beaten up for an expos his magazine      \n    did on the wife-swapping scene, he realizes he's stumbled upon           \n    something bigger: 'A blackmail racket that preys on a person's           \n    ability to pay for an indiscretion!' He quickly recruits reporter Al     \n    Gentry and Gentry's galpal Janice to pose as married swingers and        \n    answer ads in (then-real) tabloids such as Go-Go Girl and Expositor.     \n    Things go bad almost immediately when they visit suburbanites Mr. and    \n    Mrs. 'M.' Though Al and Mrs. M (MONICA DAVIS of The Pill and The         \n    Swap) get it on in the bedroom, Mr. M -- whose motto is 'Find 'em,       \n    force 'em, forget 'em!' -- almost rapes Janice in the living room,       \n    forcing her to quit the assignment: 'You didn't tell me it would be      \n    this disgusting! Disgusting! Disgusting!'                                \n                                                                             \n    But Al gets 'her feathers back in line' and they're soon meeting with    \n    a fat Texan and his cowgirl wife (UTA ERICKSON of Passion in Hot         \n    Hollows). This time it's Al that freaks after his champagne is spiked    \n    with 'that new drug LSD' and he trips out on a bizarre S&amp;M-flavored      \n    hallucination. Eventually they discover the leader of the blackmail      \n    racket which leads to a chase through a slaughterhouse and -- Oops!      \n    Watch out for those meathooks....                                        \n                                                                             \n    Witty and well-made, Unholy Matrimony is a slick, often funny piece      \n    of sexploitation that delivers the skin while surrounding it with a      \n    good story and some of the best acting outside of a Sarno film. It's     \n    a shame the film offers no cast or production credits other than         \n    Arcanum Productions, story by FOREST RUSSELL, and director ARTHUR        \n    JOHN. The only other Arcanum production we know of is the equally        \n    good The Love Cult so we assume the same director and production team    \n    did that one as well. (The Love Cult also has no credits.)               \n    Nevertheless, we recognized the less-than gallant reporter as ALAN       \n    DELLAY, an excellent New York-based character actor with a               \n    marvelously expressive face whom you might recall as the captive         \n    theater critic in Blood Sucking Freaks, and the joke-telling             \n    executive in Putney Swope (where he's billed as Archie -- any            \n    relation to Forest? -- Russell). Another Putney alumnus is DAVID KIRK    \n    (the Mario in 'How many syllables, Mario?') who plays editor Bremmer.    \n    In addition to nudie-vets Davis, Erickson, and the anonymous but         \n    recognizable actress playing Janice, cute little SHARON KENT is seen     \n    posing for topless photos.                                               \n                                                                             \n    And the next time you need a wedding gift, you might want to consider    \n    ropes, whips, and a branding iron.
