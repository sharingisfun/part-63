It is originally an ATI graphics demo to demonstrate the Radeon 9700's abilities, but it also works on NVidia cards (Geforce 5 and higher).\n\n\nAdditional Info &amp; Tips:\n\nThis is a Tweaked version: It doesn't display the logos while the demo is running and it runs in Developer Mode (more functions, see the ReadMe for Shortcut Keys)\n\nBefore you run the demo, change the resolution, multisampletype and quality by editing Sushi.ini - You can force the Aspect Ratio and the Refresh Rate by removing the slashes and modify the values.\nIf you get an D3DAw Error, try to lower or disable the multisample settings. \n\nRun without loading screen:\nCreate a shortcut to PipeDream.exe and add the parameter -noloading\nExample: &quot;PipeDream Directory\\PipeDream.exe&quot; -noloading\n\n\nAnimusic HD (Blu-ray Rip): http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6138943\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:259172f860bb99d5210ff7d693c369a0111bd09c","amp;dn":"Animusic+-+Pipe+Dream+%5BReal-Time+Demo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"259172f860bb99d5210ff7d693c369a0111bd09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,145,114,248,96,187,153,213,33,15,247,214,147,195,105,160,17,27,208,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
