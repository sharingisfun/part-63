Royle and Singleton battle each other for their respective empires.\n\nThe film, one of many epic melodramas produced by Hollywood at the time, was widely forgotten after its first theatrical release in 1950. Bright Leaf found new life in 2003, when it played prominently in the documentary Bright Leaves, by filmmaker Ross McElwee, a descendant of the man whose life was reflected in both the novel and film.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/9103/brightleaf1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/9103/brightleaf1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img78.imageshack.us/img78/8153/brightleaf2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img78.imageshack.us/img78/8153/brightleaf2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------not my rip-----------\n\n~~~~~~ Bright Leaf (Michael Curtiz, 1950).avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,643,806,822                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:50:30                \n\nFrame Count:....................................158959             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1842                 \n\n......MPEG-4..............................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.250&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2    \n\n**************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
