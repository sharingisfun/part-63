I have assembled these update packs so that everyone can use the latest version/sp that was released.\nI omitted 6.1 and 7.1 as those users probably have a support contract and/or are still in warranty, thus they can access the updates.\n\n== Contents ==\n\n- The latest fixpack for 4.3.3, ML11 and Post ML11 bundle\n- The latest fixpack for 5.1, ML9 and Past ML9 bundle\n- The latest fixpack for 5.3, 5300-12, SP 5 and requisite SP1\n- Various PDFs with security and administration tips for 5.3\n- Firmware updates for 7028-6E1, 7028-6C1, 9112-265 (needed in order to use 5.3, if you have those machines).\n\n== Instructions ==\n\n- To upgrade to 5.3 if you use the pSeries 610 or InteliStation Power 265, you need to first update the firmware. (AIX 5.3 isn't included in this torrent).\n- Read each of the README files in the corresponding directory for the update instructions. Don't skip this step.\n\n== Seed ==\n\n- Don't delete the files even if you are not uploading. You don't need to keep torrent uploading all the time, but if members request seeders, be kind and seed for a couple of days.\n\n~bgalakazam","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b2eaccf9c3652aed04f6eb6e2c66d1ad3666b3","amp;dn":"AIX+4.3.3+5.1+5.3+Updates+%2F+Fix+Packs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b2eaccf9c3652aed04f6eb6e2c66d1ad3666b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,178,234,204,249,195,101,42,237,4,246,235,110,44,102,209,173,54,102,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
