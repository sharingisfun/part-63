Our five bonkers Scrappy      \n  Racers are flying down the M4 motorway to glorious south Wales.       \n  Destination: Pendine Sands. The long trip down is going to be a test  \n  of endurance for the ingenious competitors. Can their robust          \n  contraptions manage the miles?                                        \n                                                                        \n  If they make it, the 'flat as a snooker table' Sands await. They      \n  have seen many land speed tests in the past (including the famous     \n  Bluebird). Each team get eight hours in a local scrapyard to torch,   \n  cut, weld, bash and bolt their road runners into racers.              \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.channel4.com/programmes/scrapheap-challenge-the-scrappy-ra&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.channel4.com/programmes/scrapheap-challenge-the-scrappy-ra&lt;/a&gt; \n  ces                                                                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1b6c2f7d78697e6c5b7c767a727735787476&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd5587eb5d91539857b8302df2c2b809d071842","amp;dn":"Scrapheap.Challenge.The.Scrappy.Races.S01E02.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd5587eb5d91539857b8302df2c2b809d071842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,213,88,126,181,217,21,57,133,123,131,2,223,44,43,128,157,7,24,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
