They reach a safehouse run by NikolaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Loyalist allies in Himachal Pradesh, india. While Soap receives medical attention, Vladamir Makarov's forces storm the safehouse in an attempt to kill the three. Yuri, Nikolai's best soldier with a grudge against Makarov, aids Price in giving Soap an adrenaline shot to keep his heart going, and with securing a safe route to an extraction point out of the country. Together, the four are all that remains of the now-disavowed Task Force 141. Price's team then goes into hiding for two months, while Makarov does the same.\n\n\nInfos Upload:\n\nMac OS X 10.6-10.7\n4 Go Ram(min)\nNVIDIA:OK\nATI:OK\nINTEL HD 3000 - Works but low performance.\nSize:15Go\n\nPORT:WINESKIN!!\n\nRun on my Mac:\n\n-Imac(1920x1200)\n-10.6.8\n-Intel Core 2 duo 3,06GHz\n-4 Go de Ram\n-Nvidia GeForce GT 130 512 Mo de VRam\n\nWARNING!!!:\n\nAt launch the game, a window will open wineskin, click &quot;no&quot;.\nIf the game you have too much lag, go to the video config in the game, put the resolution you want and go to &quot;Advanced Video&quot; and set the setting to &quot;Normal&quot;!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d82a84792c6e611c6c38a511e6846e5b57a8adb","amp;dn":"Modern+Warfare+3+%28Port.WineSkin%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d82a84792c6e611c6c38a511e6846e5b57a8adb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,130,168,71,146,198,230,17,198,195,138,81,30,104,70,229,181,122,138,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
