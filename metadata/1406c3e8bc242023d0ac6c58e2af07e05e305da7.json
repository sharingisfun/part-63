These concerts not only delight the audiences in the  \n  Musikverein in Vienna, but also enjoy great international popularity  \n  through the world wide television broadcasts, which now reach over    \n  50 countries.                                                         \n                                                                        \n  Originating during a dark period of Austria's history, these          \n  concerts were initially conceived for a local audience as a reminder  \n  of better times and a source of hope for the future. Today millions   \n  of people throughout the world are similarly encouraged by the        \n  light-hearted yet subtly profound character of this music, and draw   \n  joy and optimism for the New Year ahead.                              \n                                                                        \n  It is the desire of the Philharmonic not only to provide musically    \n  definitive interpretations of the masterworks of this genre, but at   \n  the same time, as musical ambassadors of Austria, to send people all  \n  over the world a New Year's greeting in the spirit of hope,           \n  friendship and peace.                                                 \n                                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/index.php?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/index.php?&lt;/a&gt;                         \n                                                                        \n  set_language=en&amp;cccpage=newyearsconcert                               \n                                                                        \n  Note: A small video skip around the middle, sorry.
