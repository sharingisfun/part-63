Around 1620 BC, a gigantic volcano in the Aegean Sea stirred from its 19,000-year slumber. \n\n\n\nThe eruption tore the island of Thera apart, producing massive tsunamis that flooded the nearby island of Crete, the centre of Europe\\\\\\'s first great civilisation, the Minoans. This apocalyptic event, many experts now believe, led to the eventual downfall of the Minoans, and provided the inspiration for Plato when he later wrote about the people of a mighty island, Atlantis, which sank beneath the waves and was lost forever, \\\\\\'in a single day and a night of misfortune\\\\\\'. Based on the work of leading scientists, archaeologists and historians, this film immerses viewers in the exotic world of the Minoans.\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Tom Conti\n======================\n\n\nWritten by: Rhidian Brook\n=========================\n\n\nDirected by: Tony Mitchell\n==========================\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Atlantis End Of A World Birth Of A Legend\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:59:08\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2195 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    External English\nFile Size:...........:    928 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1744825/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1744825/&lt;/a&gt;\n  \n  \n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae5b100db1e93a8374c0d92d70339dc64cd19711","amp;dn":"Atlantis+End+Of+A+World+Birth+Of+A+Legend-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae5b100db1e93a8374c0d92d70339dc64cd19711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,91,16,13,177,233,58,131,116,192,217,45,112,51,157,198,76,209,151,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
