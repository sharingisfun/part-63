There is some speculation that the band is actually from Switzerland, as that is where the original LP was privately released. Either way, AGAMEMNON S/T is keyboard dominated space/psych/prog music. The lyrics are in German. It is reminiscent of Minotaurus, Epidaurus and in some parts Kyrie Eleison. This album features the first two stories from the mythologic Greek hero. It is divided into 2 main tracks as \u001cParts I and II\u001d. \n\nProgressive Rock Space/Psychodelic with Swiss lyrics\n\nAir Plane 7177 We will not forgot!
