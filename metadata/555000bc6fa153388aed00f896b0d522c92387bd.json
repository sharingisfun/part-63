Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is the Junior Campaign Manager for Mike Morris (George Clooney), Governor of Pennsylvania and a Democratic presidential candidate, competing against Arkansas Senator Ted Pullman (Michael Mantell). The candidates are campaigning in Ohio. A win for Morris would all but guarantee him the nomination; a win for Pullman would give him vital momentum. Both campaigns are also attempting to enlist the endorsement of North Carolina Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright).\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 7.4/10\nDirected by: George Clooney\nStarring: Paul Giamatti, George Clooney and Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\nRelease Name: The.Ides.of.March.DVDRip.XviD-DEFACED\nSize: 1 CD (700 MB)\nQuality: 640ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€272, 844 kbps, MP3 128 kbps\nRuntime: 101 mins\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:555000bc6fa153388aed00f896b0d522c92387bd","amp;dn":"The+Ides+of+March+DVDRip+XviD-DEFACED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"555000bc6fa153388aed00f896b0d522c92387bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,80,0,188,111,161,83,56,138,237,0,248,150,176,213,34,201,35,135,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
