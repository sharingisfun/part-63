Maybe a few have been -- but I'd argue that most politicians are enemies of freedom.\n\nTonight, Steve Forbes and John Allison, former CEO of BB&amp;T bank, will talk about how entrepreneurs champion freedom, not bureaucracy and big government.\n\nSome freedom fighters come from places you wouldn't expect, like Hollywood. Syndicated columnist Deroy Murdock, also a senior fellow with the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, will try to explain how blockbuster movies like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Jerry Maguire' broadcast the message of liberty, even when they don't intend to.\n\nWashington, Jefferson, Franklin... most of the heroes of the American Revolution were male. Where were the women? British author John Blundell has written on America's &quot;Ladies of Liberty.&quot; He, along with Nicole Neily from the Independent Women's Forum tell stories of heroic female freedom fighters that were news to me.\n\nFinally, we honor the Institute for Justice, a law firm that fights in the courts to free small businesses from the chains of regulation that governments impose.\n\nJoin us tonight as we celebrate the champions of freedom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af2904424ac18cc8dd4ea6cf94680c28b871c37c","amp;dn":"20120105-Stossel-%5BChampions+of+Freedom%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af2904424ac18cc8dd4ea6cf94680c28b871c37c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,41,4,66,74,193,140,200,221,78,166,207,148,104,12,40,184,113,195,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
