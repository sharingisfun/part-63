This\ntext describes effective methods and equipment for collecting, identifying, rearing, examining, and preserving insects and mites, and for storing and caring for specimens in collections. It also provides instructions for the construction of many kinds of collecting equipment, traps, rearing cages, and storage units, as well as updated and illustrated keys for identification of the classes of arthropods and the orders of insects. Such information not only aids hobbyists and professionals in preparing insect collections, but it has become essential in documenting and standardizing collections of entomological evidence in forensic as well as pest management sciences. \n\n* Over 400 professionally drawn illustrations \n* Identification keys to find arthropod orders \n* Comprehensive reading list \n* Detailed glossary of terms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74892d31618a02140c9788bdddb5757ed7919a83","amp;dn":"Arthropod+Collection+and+Identification+-+Field+and+Laboratory+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74892d31618a02140c9788bdddb5757ed7919a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,137,45,49,97,138,2,20,12,151,136,189,221,181,117,126,215,145,154,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
