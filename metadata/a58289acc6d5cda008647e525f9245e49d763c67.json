Camp counselors have proven to be no match for Jason\n in the earlier films of this series, but this time he encounters more\n formidable opponents in the form of members of a motorcycle gang. The action\n takes place on a rustic farm that provides both the serene setting and the\n privacy Jason desires when stalking his prey.\n\n CAST \n\n Dana Kimmell ..................................................

But Jason gets his mask, that's kinda kewl :)\n\n aGGr0 iNFO \n \n aGGr0 has been around since 2oo2, at first mainly releasing mp3 and svcd.\n Since late 2oo3 we are only concentrating on quality rips of quality movies.\n We just love AC3 and XViD, and love those movies you won't find elsewhere.\n We are on a quest to widen the minds of those who enjoy film, with lots of\n different types of movies, from lots of different decades. From time to time\n we may release a dupe, but we don't believe that a good release in XViD is\n a dupe on a crappy release made on svcd 3 years ago. If you don't agree,\n then nuke us. We love movies, and we love to spread them for _your_ pleasure,\n not nukers. We are a small group, consisting of friends, ripping the movies\n we love to watch. If you like our releases - spread them. And remember that\n a movie worth watching is a movie worth buying.
