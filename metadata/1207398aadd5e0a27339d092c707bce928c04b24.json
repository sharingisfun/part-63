The lone woman charged, Mary Surratt, 42, owns a boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and others met and planned the simultaneous attacks. Against the ominous back-drop of post-Civil War Washington, newly-minted lawyer, Frederick Aiken, a 28-year-old Union war-hero, reluctantly agrees to defend Surratt before a military tribunal. As the trial unfolds, Aiken realizes his client may be innocent and that she is being used as bait and hostage in order to capture the only conspirator to have escaped a massive manhunt, her own son.\n\nTechnical data file:\nQuality: BDRip 720p\nFormat: MKV\nVideo Codec: x264\nAudio Codec: AAC\nVideo: 1280 x 536, 23.976 fps, 761 Kbps,\nAudio # 1: English, original, 48.100 kHz, AAC, 2 ch, ~ 128.00 kbps VBR\nAudio # 2: Russian, 48.100 kHz, AAC, 2 ch, ~ 128.00 kbps VBR\n\n[img]http://iho.kz/p/38a8139b84a49fe562cac7ddb452eff8.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://iho.kz/p/3f90ad1297e1b73f8585a854bcae85c8.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://iho.kz/p/d336a78e71a9415a3d91b8b14d8eaa1b.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://iho.kz/p/8039d1afc74c4a8307eb1d0c0b2be29d.png[/img]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1207398aadd5e0a27339d092c707bce928c04b24","amp;dn":"The+Conspirator+%5B2010%5D+BDRip+720p+%5BEng+Rus%5D-Junoon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1207398aadd5e0a27339d092c707bce928c04b24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,7,57,138,173,213,224,162,115,57,208,146,199,7,188,233,40,192,75,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
