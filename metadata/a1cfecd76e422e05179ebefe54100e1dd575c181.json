Film director Alma HarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢el tells the story of three protagonists. The trials of Benny Parrish, a young boy diagnosed with bipolar disorder whose troubled soul and vivid imagination create both suffering and joy for him and his complex and loving family. The story of CeeJay Thompson, a black teenager and aspiring football player who has taken refuge in Bombay Beach hoping to avoid the same fate of his cousin who was murdered by a gang of youths in Los Angeles; and that of Red, an ancient survivor, once an oil field worker, living on the fumes of whiskey, cigarettes and an irrepressible love of life. Together these portraits form a triptych of manhood in its various ages and guisesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nGenre: Documentary | Drama | Musical\nIMDB rating: 6.7/10\nDirected by: Alma HarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢el\n\nRelease Name: Bombay.Beach.2011.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: XviD , 640ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€352 , 1135 Kbps\nAudio: English, MP3, 132 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 16mn\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1cfecd76e422e05179ebefe54100e1dd575c181","amp;dn":"Bombay+Beach+2011+DVDRip+XviD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1cfecd76e422e05179ebefe54100e1dd575c181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,207,236,215,110,66,46,5,23,158,190,254,84,16,14,29,213,117,193,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
