His first solo album, Lionel Richie, grabbed the world's        \n  attention, whilst the follow-up, Can't Slow Down, turned him into a   \n  global superstar. But could he maintain sustained popularity without  \n  the group he'd known as brothers behind him?                          \n                                                                        \n  This documentary shows how Lionel achieved his dream of becoming 'as  \n  big as the Beatles' and how much of what he learnt from his years     \n  with the Commodores prepared him for that success.                    \n                                                                        \n  Contributors include: Billboard Magazine editor Adam White; Motown    \n  songwriter and producer Gloria Jones; Kenny Rogers; video director    \n  Bob Giraldi; songwriter and producer David Foster; General Manager    \n  at Motown in 1978, Keith Harris; UK soul singer Lemar; and Pearly     \n  Gates of the Flirtations                                              \n                                                                        \n  Enjoy!!                                                               \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;334407555041564473545e525a5f1d505c5e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdb8a7b01c01b0f327842ed7bdb0c7a1814dc7b0","amp;dn":"Lionel.Richie.Dancing.on.the.Ceiling.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdb8a7b01c01b0f327842ed7bdb0c7a1814dc7b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,184,167,176,28,1,176,243,39,132,46,215,189,176,199,161,129,77,199,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
