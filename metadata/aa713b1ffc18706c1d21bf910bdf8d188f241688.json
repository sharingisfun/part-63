In this exciting mew album the band has seamlessly blended a wide palette of musical genres into a fresh and cohesive 10-track package that is full of life and energy.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rare to stumble upon a band that brings as much joy and creative flare to their music as the Ragbirds. Led by the energetic front woman, Erin Zindle, the band tastefully unites multi-cultural rhythms with a roots rock flavor that is as captivating and flirty, as it is smart. \n\nThe five-piece project is clearly built around the multi-talented Zindle, who is not only the singer and songwriter but is proficient in a range of stringed instruments. This classically trained violinist can aptly pluck the eight-stringed mandolin, wield a wild accordion and rock the banjo while maintaining lead vocals. Surrounding Zindle's earthy-sweet voice is the whirlwind of a guitarist T.J. Zindle, dynamic bassist Brian Crist, drummer Loren Kranz and standout percussionist Randall Moore. \n\nChock-full of radio-friendly material, TravelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Machine showcases the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s skills with adventurous lyrics and a unique blend of styles. The album kicks off with the contagious opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSix WheelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - an energetic song with Afro-Cuban rhythms and a frisky pop melody that manages to linger in your head all day long. The second track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFollowing YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has obvious bluegrass influences with just a charming wink of country twang. \n\nSweeping throughout the album is a breezy quality that makes you feel like celebrating. Tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSilence is EverywhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMoribayassa (IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Fly Away)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ highlight the percussive prowess of the group with layers of thick drums and sounds reminiscent of an African village. In ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLearn to ShineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ZindleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beautiful voice leads a soaring reprise you will want to hear while youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re driving towards a mountain sunset, while the lively Cajun-Zydeco-inspired ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe BullyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ seems straight out of the bayou. The bands diversity shines in the unique ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAcrobatsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a Circus-waltz with haunting accordion undertones, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMercy of the SeaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a rock Sea-Chanty with a classic swagger. All and all the album takes the listener on a great musical journey that is as inspiring as the world landscape from which it is drawn. \n\nBeginning January 1st TravelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Machine will hit on-line stores and boutique music shops around the country. A bright and diverse addition to any music collection, the album provides charming, danceable songs that can be enjoyed by listeners of all ages.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/06/02/the-ragbirds/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa713b1ffc18706c1d21bf910bdf8d188f241688","amp;dn":"The+Ragbirds...Travelin%5C%27+Machine%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa713b1ffc18706c1d21bf910bdf8d188f241688","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,113,59,31,252,24,112,108,29,33,191,145,11,223,141,24,143,36,22,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
