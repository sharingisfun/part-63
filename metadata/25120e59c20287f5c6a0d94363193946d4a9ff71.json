Yoshiko Yatsu, a former model with a &quot;beatnik&quot; persona, is a Suzuki discovery.  Her quirky character overpowers the film.\n\n\n\nOn a sweltering summer day, a gang of high school delinquents rove through an amusement park. One group member, JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ Sugita (Tamio Kawachi), harasses one of the girls which invokes an extended verbal rebuke. JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ leaves the group and returns home where he lives with his single mother, Misayo (Tomoko Naraoka). She is the mistress of Keigo Nanbara (Shinsuke Ashida), a business man, both of whom JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ is constantly at odds with. JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ gets in a fight with Nanbara, tears violently through the house and steals some money. Another girl from the group, Toshimi Tani (Yoshiko Yatsu), has a crush on JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½. The two start a physical relationship but JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ is decidedly cooler towards the affair. At Misayo's request, Nanbara lectures JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ about his disreputable lifestyle and relationship but is met with mockery.\n\n\n\nThe following day, Nanbara and Misayo, as well as JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ and his friends, go to a Zushi beach resort. JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ convinces one friend, Etsuko (Shinako Nakagawa), to seduce Nanbara. Toshimi then leads Misayo to the bedroom where Nanbara and Etsuko are having their tryst. JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ observes his mother's distress and is wracked with guilt. He and Toshimi steal a convertible and speed away. Nanbara catches up with them at a rest stop and, in a struggle, JirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ kills Nanbara with a wrench. The two continue their frantic flight only to collide with a truck, dying soon afterward. A crowd has gathered around the wreck when Misayo arrives. An observer mutters, &quot;Everything went wrong.&quot;\n\n\n\n-------my rip------\n\n\n\n~~~~~~ Subete ga kurutteru.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................760,383,488                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:14:29                \n\nFrame Count:....................................107136             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................288                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................2.444                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1224                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.252&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2     \n\n**************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
