OS X El Capitan might seem like a strange name, but it's meant to highlight the OS's position as an update that brings under-the-hood improvements and refinements to OS X Yosemite.\r\n\r\nIn real life, El Capitan is one of the most popular rock formations and landmarks located within Yosemite National Park. The &quot;El Capitan&quot; name for OS X 10.11 reflects a long-running OS X naming scheme that's used to denote updates that are refinements to previous updates, following in the footsteps of Leopard/Snow Leopard and Lion/Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nWith El Capitan, Apple focused on two major areas: user experience and performance. Improvements to window management, apps, and Spotlight search enhance the way we use our Macs, while under-the-hood additions like Metal graphics technology make everyday activities like launching apps faster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d71093b199f8b8c9dbabccd1e7a010165f6af9c","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+XEl+Capitan+v10+11+3+%2815D21%29+Incl+%28USB+Installer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d71093b199f8b8c9dbabccd1e7a010165f6af9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,113,9,59,25,159,139,140,157,186,188,205,30,122,1,1,101,246,175,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
