After his friend is sent to prison for the crime, Ken spends his life running away from his shame. Seeking redemption, he teaches mixed Martial Arts out of a community youth center. But Ken is ultimately forced to face his past when the orphaned boy finds his way into KenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life, and KenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s murderous friend is released from prison. When he discovers that these two events are not a coincidence, Ken must choose between a heroic act of self-sacrifice or the self-preservation of running away.\n\n\n\n\nGenre: Action\nIMDB rating: 4.1/10\nDirected by: Jino Kang\nStarring: Jino Kang, Bill Duff and Gina Baretta\n\nRelease Name: Fist.2.Fist.2011.DvDRip.XviD.Ac3.Feel-Free\nSize: 1.10 GiB\nVideo: XviD | 640 x 360 | 1 236 Kbps\nAudio: English | AC-3 | 448 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 32mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ee0dfff7de46721987c1b4da3d90db18af215c9","amp;dn":"Fist.2.Fist.2011.DvDRip.XviD.Ac3-Feel-Free","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ee0dfff7de46721987c1b4da3d90db18af215c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,224,223,255,125,228,103,33,152,124,27,77,163,217,13,177,138,242,21,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
