Inspired by the code words that were used to get into the Speakeasies of the Prohibition era, &quot;Joe sent me&quot;, was one of the most common ones. &quot;It was the perfect metaphor for my new album, saying something about the transmission of ideas through time, the secret ranges of the voice, fleeting nights of love and desire, the archiving of dreams, memory, and the imagination.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

Heart of Wax\n14. Hook\n\nDaou says of the project:\n\n    The Idea behind Joe Sent Me was inspired by a recent walk in New York City's Times Square, and my memory of a trip I made to Barcelona in 2006. What I remember most about the city was its uniquely dynamic and vibrant clash of the myriad sounds of the Spanish language, the co-mingling of its cultures and countries....I've created Joe Sent Me to reflect the way my mind reconstructs my memory of Barcelona.... the aim is to break down each poem into its component parts: word/page, sound/mouth, structure/form, rhythm/repetition, reader/interpreter, eye/viewer, meaning/intonation, imagination/interpretation.\n\nArranger: Vanessa Daou.\n\nPersonnel: Vanessa Daou (vocals); Anthony Johnson (guitar, bass instrument, drums); Stephen Ellis (guitar); Matt Hong (saxophone); Wynne Bennett (piano, keyboards); Mike Degen (programming).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76e1202dea7a984fe088efbd4bfd85fc0b093f9","amp;dn":"Vanessa+Daou+-+Joe+Sent+Me+-+2008+-+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76e1202dea7a984fe088efbd4bfd85fc0b093f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,110,18,2,222,167,169,132,254,8,142,251,212,191,216,95,192,176,147,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
