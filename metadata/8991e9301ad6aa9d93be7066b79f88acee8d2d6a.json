He has spent his life in the stifling and claustrophobic cathedral town of Cloisterham in a state of frustrated ambition and has become addicted to opium in an attempt to still his ennui and expand his horizons.\n\nBut the opium is fracturing JasperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mind so that even as his soul reaches for the sublime in his music, his darker self has conceived a murderous hatred of his nephew Edwin Drood who, he believes, stands between him and the lovely Rosa. The stage is set for a story of mental and moral decline as we discover exactly how far Jasper will go to attain the object of his desire.\n\nMatthew Rhys is John Jasper; Rory Kinnear is Reverend Septimus Crisparkle; Freddie Fox is Edwin Drood; Tamzin Merchant is Rosa Bud; Alun Armstrong is Hiram Grewgious, RosaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guardian; Julia McKenzie plays the ReverendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother, Mrs Crisparkle; David Dawson is Bazzard; Ron Cook is Durdles; Sacha Dhawan is Neville Landless; Amber Rose Revah is Helena Landless, NevilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s twin sister; Ian McNeice is Mayor Sapsea; Janet Dale is Miss Twinkleton; Ellie Haddington (Luther) is Princess Puffer and young Alfie Davis plays Deputy.\n\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 1280*720\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8991e9301ad6aa9d93be7066b79f88acee8d2d6a","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+The+Mystery+of+Edwin+Drood+1+of+2+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8991e9301ad6aa9d93be7066b79f88acee8d2d6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,145,233,48,26,214,170,157,147,190,112,102,183,159,136,172,238,141,45,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
