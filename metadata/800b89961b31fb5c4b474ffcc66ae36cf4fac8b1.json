Johnny has come marching home.  But there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s little fanfare and no meaningful work for one war vet.  There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only the desperate life of an unjustly convicted fugitive.  Twice he is sentenced to a chain gang.  Twice he escapes.  They can put his hands and feet in irons, but not his will to be free.\n\nPaul Muni gives a jolting, lived-in performance in this powerhouse classic directed by Mervyn LeRoy (Little Caesar) and based on autobiographical writings by chain-gang escapee Robert E. Burns.  Like many \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'30s crime sagas, this one thrills with brisk pacing and gritty realities.  Yet it also stands apart as a film that made a difference.  It ignited protests that led to vital penal reforms.  And Burns himself received a commuted sentence.  He would be a fugitive no more.\n\nSource DVD Info:\n------------------------------\nMovie name: Drive G: [I_AM_A_FUGITIVE_FROM_CHAINGANG]\nLocation[VTS:01 PGC:1]\nTime: 01:32:30.000\nVideo Codec: MPEG2\nVideo Standard: NTSC\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 4:3\n\nAudio and subtitle streams info:\n------------------------------\nEnglish AC3 1ch (0x80) [U]\n\nTarget info:\n------------------------------\nProfile name: AVI - Audio Video Interleaved(*.avi)\n\nHas video stream: Yes\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1500 kbps\nVideo Size: 720*480\nVideo FrameRate: 29 FPS\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 4:3\n\nHas audio stream: Yes\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128.00 kbps\nAudio SampleRate: 44100 Hz\nAudio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Volume: 100%\n\nThis is my first torrent upload.
