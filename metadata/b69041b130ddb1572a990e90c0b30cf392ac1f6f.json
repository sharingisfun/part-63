The information is subdivided into sections based on the class of ceramic, e.g. Nitrides-silicon nitride, sialon, boron carbide, aluminium nitride etc. Each section consists of a short introduction, a table comparing basic data and a series of data sheets. The book adopts standardised data in order to help the reader in finding and comparing different data and identifying the required information. It is designed to complement the existing Chapman &amp; Hall publications on high performance materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b69041b130ddb1572a990e90c0b30cf392ac1f6f","amp;dn":"Advanced+Technical+Ceramics+-+Directory+and+Databook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b69041b130ddb1572a990e90c0b30cf392ac1f6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,144,65,177,48,221,177,87,42,153,14,144,192,179,12,243,146,172,31,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
