It is part goat, part spider, and its milk can be used to create artificial spider's web.\n\nIt is part of a new field of research, synthetic biology, with a radical aim: to break down nature into spare parts so that we can rebuild it however we please.\n\nThis technology is already being used to make bio-diesel to power cars. Other researchers are looking at how we might, one day, control human emotions by sending 'biological machines' into our brains.\n\n\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 1280*720\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:478c368c83cd7febe2cd92cb314a94e231ce23c7","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+-+Horizon_+Playing+God+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"478c368c83cd7febe2cd92cb314a94e231ce23c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,140,54,140,131,205,127,235,226,205,146,203,49,74,148,226,49,206,35,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
