Simple to use: just push the button.\n\nPowerMax is a mobile application that will help you extend the battery life of your mobile device. When you're on the go and notice that your mobile is about to die, or if you know it's going to be a long day until your next chance to charge, one touch activates PowerMax. PowerMax will save your battery and better manage power usage for you.\n\nPowerMax is one of the most friendly and simple to use applications available today. On the main screen there is an On/Off switch. By clicking switch on, the Power Saver will be activated and save your battery, and by clicking off, PowerMax will restore your normal settings. When Power Saver Mode is on, your phone's functionality will be significantly reduced. But don't worry, this is just to save you power, you can always use your mobile's features on demand (email, internet applications etc).\n\nIn testing we have seen a wide range of battery life improvement ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from a mediocre 20% more to an impressive 100% ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ doubling battery life! Your device usage pattern has a direct affect on the savings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ typically the more you use your device the higher the savings you will enjoy. Please note that our reports on the percent improvement in battery life will only start a few days after you install PowerMax. Why? Because PowerMax first learns what is your normal battery consumption, the baseline, and then calculates the improvement.\n\nPowerMax can be downloaded for free then used for an evaluation period of one week. Once the evaluation period is over, PowerMax users who are not interested in purchasing a key can still continue using PowerMax in advertising supported mode. You can purchase a license key at any time to unlock the full functionality of the PowerMax.\n\n** Please EMail us if you run into any problems!
