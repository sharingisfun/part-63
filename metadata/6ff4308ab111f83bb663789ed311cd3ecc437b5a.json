The album heavily steeped in the living Celtic tradition has an added influence that prevails through all the tracks. It is something that I can't explain and even so much so that I've put off writing this review for some time feeling nothing I can say can do it justice. Its an influence that sounds like it came from Faerie itself! Just like Turlough O'Carolan sitting on his favorite hill for hours than composing his unique planxty style of music. This added element on this album is definitely Celtic in roots but I've never heard anything like it before. Its like the spiritual side of fantasy. One doesn't just happen to think of faeries and other sorts of creatures of that ilk when listening to this but they think of those things with a sense of awe that begs the listener to leave their bodies and join with them, dance with them, become them, see the beauty in all things like they do and than return with a spiritually heightened state of mind. Maybe I'm being too poetic, but seriously its like a sunrise, the only way to express it is through poetry.\n\nThe songs on this album have a long range from popy love songs, to deep fantasy, to historic to sweet and fun. Each track captivating, each making one question how an artist can be so good. Hearing the whole album through and it returning once again to the 1st track you will not want to change CDs but to listen to it again, than repeat this process for days. Corbel fan? buy this! you won't be disappointed.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\n[img]http://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif[/img]\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/12/26/cecile-corbel/[/url]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ff4308ab111f83bb663789ed311cd3ecc437b5a","amp;dn":"C%26Atilde%3B%26copy%3Bcile+Corbel...SongbookVol3%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ff4308ab111f83bb663789ed311cd3ecc437b5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,244,48,138,177,17,248,59,182,99,120,158,211,17,205,62,204,67,123,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
