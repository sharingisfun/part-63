But there is just one problem.\n Jason never drowned in Crystal Lake and lived in the nearby woods as a\n hermit all this time. The day that Alice beheaded his mother, Jason saw\n everything and his heart filled with thirst for revenge. Two months later\n Alice gets stabbed by an ice pick in the temple and dissapears. Is Jason\n behind this? Five years later a camp next do to Camp Crystal Lake is build\n and the counselors start snooping around the old, abondoned camp ruins. This\n makes Jason very upset, since his shack is next to the remains of Camp\n Crystal Lake and what is inside the shack shall be kept secret forever, even\n if it means killing nine people!\n\n CAST \n\n Amy Steel .......................................................

Deputy Winslow \n\n RiPPER'S NOTES \n\n Now Jason's pissed. And he will be for the coming.. uhm.. like, a million\n movies more :)\n\n aGGr0 iNFO \n \n aGGr0 has been around since 2oo2, at first mainly releasing mp3 and svcd.\n Since late 2oo3 we are only concentrating on quality rips of quality movies.\n We just love AC3 and XViD, and love those movies you won't find elsewhere.\n We are on a quest to widen the minds of those who enjoy film, with lots of\n different types of movies, from lots of different decades. From time to time\n we may release a dupe, but we don't believe that a good release in XViD is\n a dupe on a crappy release made on svcd 3 years ago. If you don't agree,\n then nuke us. We love movies, and we love to spread them for _your_ pleasure,\n not nukers. We are a small group, consisting of friends, ripping the movies\n we love to watch. If you like our releases - spread them. And remember that\n a movie worth watching is a movie worth buying.
