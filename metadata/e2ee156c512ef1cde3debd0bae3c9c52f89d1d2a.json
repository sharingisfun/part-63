Churchill is worried about Russia's        \n           post-war plans for Europe but most not endanger the            \n           increasingly threatened alliance between the west and          \n           Russian A British military attached to the Red Army            \n           discovers a Russian war crime against the Polish               \n           government in exile and is seized by Stalin's feared           \n           intelligence service. He finds unexpected help from an         \n           enemy and fellow prisoner a German Captain. They discover      \n           a common bond in freemasonry and are bound by honor, oath      \n           and secrets. They are joined by Anna, a beautiful Polish       \n           nurse cast adrift on the tides of war. The three are           \n           pursued by A Ruthless Russian commander through Germany        \n           caring a secret that can change the outcome of the world       \n           and the fate of millions.
