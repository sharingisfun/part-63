Tap a hotkey, type what you want, and done! Use simple, natural language, like:\n\n&quot;Pick up Joe @ LAX tomorrow 8p&quot;\n&quot;Pay taxes before 4/15!&quot;\n&quot;Lunch tomorrow at noon&quot;\n&quot;Cycling class @6 for 1.5h&quot;\n\nAs you type, QuickCal will show you what it is thinking, as well as pointing out any schedule conflicts with events you're about to create!\n\nYou'll be amazed how much quicker you can create events than using any other calendar app (native or otherwise). Nothing is faster than typing what you want!\n\nIn addition to this, QuickCal supports &quot;Smart Reminders&quot;, which will create alarms at configurable time intervals, specific to how far in the future the event is. A meeting tomorrow? Reminder 15 min in advance. A meeting in 6 months? Remind a few _days_ in advance.\n\nThe QuickCal menu icon also will show you all events on your calendars for the current day! Quickly see what's going on at a glance.\n\nNew exciting features being actively developed!\n\nLanguages: English, French, German\n\nWhat's New\n\n* Parsing engine does not require event titles to be at the front of the entry\n  text. &quot;For 30m do something&quot;, &quot;Until 5pm Block my calendar&quot;,\n  &quot;Tuesday at Rob's House, Party 7-11p&quot; all work nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* Auto-suggest / auto-complete of common terms; learns from you over\n  timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* Can switch calendars while entering an event by adding &quot;\n /calendarname&quot; at the end of the textÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* Now will auto-detect which calendars support reminders, and which do\n  notÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* Reminders which have due dates and times will now create AlarmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n* For reminder lists which don't have a matching calendar (that is with the\n  same name), removed the need to add &quot;reminder&quot; (used to be:&quot;todo&quot;) to\n  text to flag as a reminder; just type the reminder title and you're done.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.6 and above\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0352996d4b9730e9038f4f80165416131465f27e","amp;dn":"QuickCal+v.+3.1+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0352996d4b9730e9038f4f80165416131465f27e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,82,153,109,75,151,48,233,3,143,79,128,22,84,22,19,20,101,242,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
