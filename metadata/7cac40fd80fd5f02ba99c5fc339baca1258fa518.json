Aside from the 1950 marionette special The Spirit of Christmas, it was the first animated holiday program ever produced specifically for television, originally airing in December 1962,[2] and the only one until the stop-motion Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was first shown in December 1964. The special also inspired the 1964 TV series The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo.[3] It featured the voice of Jim Backus as Magoo, with voice over appearances by Paul Frees, Morey Amsterdam, Joan Gardner, and Jack Cassidy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cac40fd80fd5f02ba99c5fc339baca1258fa518","amp;dn":"Mister+Magoo%5C%27s+Christmas+Carol+-+1962+-+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cac40fd80fd5f02ba99c5fc339baca1258fa518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,172,64,253,128,253,95,2,186,153,197,252,51,155,172,161,37,143,165,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
