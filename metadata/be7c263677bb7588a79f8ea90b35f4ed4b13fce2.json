I have assembled these update packs so that everyone can use the latest version/sp that was released.\nI omitted 6.1 and 7.1 as those users probably have a support contract and/or are still in warranty, thus they can access the updates.\n\n== Contents ==\n\n- The latest fixpack for 4.3.3, ML11 and Post ML11 bundle\n- The latest fixpack for 5.1, ML9 and Past ML9 bundle\n- The latest fixpack for 5.3, 5300-12, SP 5 and requisite SP1\n- Firmware updates for 7028-6E1, 7028-6C1, 9112-265 (needed in order to use 5.3, if you have those machines).\n\n== Instructions ==\n\n- To upgrade to 5.3 if you use the pSeries 610 or InteliStation Power 265, you need to first update the firmware. (AIX 5.3 isn't included in this torrent).\n- Read each of the README files in the corresponding directory for the update instructions. Don't skip this step.\n\n== Seed ==\n\n- Don't delete the files even if you are not uploading. You don't need to keep torrent uploading all the time, but if members request seeders, be kind and seed for a couple of days.\n\n~bgalakazam\t \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7c263677bb7588a79f8ea90b35f4ed4b13fce2","amp;dn":"AIX+4.3.3+5.1+5.3+Updates+%2F+Fix+Packs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7c263677bb7588a79f8ea90b35f4ed4b13fce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,124,38,54,119,187,117,136,167,159,142,169,11,53,244,237,75,19,252,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
