They had just tracked down a notorious\n                  serial killer, Carl Stargher, whose MO is to abduct\n                  women one at a time and place them in a secret area\n                  where they are kept for about 40 hours until they\n                  are slowly drowned. Unfortunately, the killer has\n                  fallen into an irreversible coma which means he\n                  cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim\n                  before she dies. Now, Catherine Deane must race\n                  against time to explore the twisted mind of the\n                  killer to get the information she needs, but\n                  Stargher's damaged personality poses dangers that\n                  threaten to overwhelm her.\n\n        Supplier: peken^aGGr0\n          Ripper: peken^aGGr0\n   Rippers notes: Visually Stunning And Very Intense movie.

At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since\n        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,\n         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like\n       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable\n        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.\n       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and\n         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are\n              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.\n                Remember, kids!
