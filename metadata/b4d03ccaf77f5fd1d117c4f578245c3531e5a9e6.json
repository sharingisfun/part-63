His character is &quot;everyman&quot;, much put upon but struggling through to a (usually) happy ending. He was brought up in an orphanage after his mother died and his father disowned him. He joined the army where he discovered that his performing ability was appreciated. He has worked variously on stage and screen since 1952. His theme song has become &quot;Don't laugh at me, ('cause I'm a fool)&quot; from the film 'Trouble in Store (1953)'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d03ccaf77f5fd1d117c4f578245c3531e5a9e6","amp;dn":"Norman+Wisdom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d03ccaf77f5fd1d117c4f578245c3531e5a9e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,208,60,202,247,127,95,209,209,23,196,245,120,36,92,53,49,229,169,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
