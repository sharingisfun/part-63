Walking back to their new apartment after a night out at the theatre, they encounter a thief in a dark alley, and Sam is murdered. He finds himself trapped as a ghost and realises that his death was no accident. He must warn Molly about the danger that she is in. But as a ghost he can not be seen or heard by the living, and so he tries to communicate with Molly through Oda Mae Brown, a psychic who didn't even realise that her powers were real.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27bfb2e0691914cf9c99acbb0906e15480dc3532","amp;dn":"Ghost+%281990%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27bfb2e0691914cf9c99acbb0906e15480dc3532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,191,178,224,105,25,20,207,156,153,172,187,9,6,225,84,128,220,53,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
