The majority of the film takes place during one day in HesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flat, a day on which she has decided to commit suicide. Her attempt fails and as she recovers, the story of her affair and her married life is played out in a mosaic of short and sporadic flashbacks. We soon discover the constraints of HesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comfortable marriage, which is affectionate but without sexual passion. As HesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s affair is discovered she leaves her life of comparative luxury and moves into a small dingy London flat with Freddie. HesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new lover has awakened her sexuality, but the reckless, thrill-seeking Freddie can never give her the love and stability that her husband gave. Yet to return to a life without passion would be unbearable. The film takes its title from her dilemma.\n\nGenre: Drama | Romance\nIMDB rating: 6.1/10\nDirected by: Terence Davies\nStarring: Rachel Weisz, Tom Hiddleston and Simon Russell Beale\n\nRelease Name: The.Deep.Blue.Sea.2011.SCR.XViD-DTRG\nSize: 1.24 GB\nVideo: XviD, 720ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€400, 1712 Kbps, 25.000 fps\nAudio: English, AC3, 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 34mn\n\n              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5fe1286b38da9e017fba2f96ba27901cd8749f4","amp;dn":"The.Deep.Blue.Sea.2011.SCR.XViD-DTRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5fe1286b38da9e017fba2f96ba27901cd8749f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,254,18,134,179,141,169,224,23,251,162,249,107,162,121,1,205,135,73,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
