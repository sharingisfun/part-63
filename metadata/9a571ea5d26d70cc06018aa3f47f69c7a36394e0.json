[3] The film is also the first in the series in which the protagonist see signs of how every character will die in the visions.\n\n\nIn 2009, Nine years after the explosion of Flight 180, the bridge colapse, Eight years after the pile-up on Route 23 and four years after the derailment of Devil\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Flight roller coaster, Nick O\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Bannon (Bobby Campo) has a premonition in which a number of people die when McKinley Speedway collapses following a crash. Nick panics, persuading his girlfriend, Lori Milligan (Shantel VanSanten) their friends, Janet Cunningham (Haley Webb) and Hunt Wynorski (Nick Zano), security guard George Lanter (Mykelti Williamson), mechanic Andy Kewzer (Andrew Fiscella), mother Samantha Lane (Krista Allen), racist Carter Daniels (Justin Welborn), and Andy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s girlfriend Nadia Monroy (Stephanie HonorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©) to leave, escaping seconds before Nick\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s vision becomes a reality. As Nick is explaining what he saw to the survivors, a stray tire flies off the stadium and obliterates Nadia.\nJust days after the disaster, Carter attempts to burn a cross on George\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s front lawn, but it backfires when he is set on fire and blown apart by his tow truck. The next day Samantha also dies after her eye gets perforated by a stone propelled by a lawnmower outside the beauty salon. When Nick and Lori hear of the deaths, they research about premonitions and learn about the previous disasters then they realize that Death never meant for them to survive and is now coming for them.\nWhile Janet and Hunt refuse to believe, Nick convinces George and Lori to help him conquer Death\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s plan. The group try to save Andy, but he is killed after a carbon dioxide tank drives him to a chain-linked fence, but Nick gets new visions and they split up to save Hunt and Janet. Lori and George successfully rescue Janet from a malfunctioning car wash, but Nick arrives at the pool too late to save Hunt, who dies when he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s unable to pull himself free from the pool\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s vacuum system as it disembowels him.\nGeorge considers suicide but is unable to kill himself, leading the survivors to believe that saving Janet had stopped Death\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s plan. Nick decides to take Lori on a holiday, but she has already gone to the mall with Janet. While at the theater, Lori begins to see odd warnings suggesting they are not out of danger as Nick realizes that there was another survivor: Jonathan Groves (Jackson Walker). Jonathan is crushed by a bathtub just before Nick and George can make it to the hospital, and George is run over by an ambulance shortly thereafter.\nLeft on his own, Nick arrives at the theater just in time to save Lori from an explosion that kills Janet and several others. However another explosion causes the mall to collapse, and Lori is annihilated by the escalator. Just as she dies, Nick awakens outside the hospital and realizes it was all a vision, but is not able to save George from his fate. Thanks to his vision, Nick is able to locate the source of the initial explosion and extinguish the flames.\nTwo weeks later, the trio celebrates their survival in a cafe. Nick begins to take notice of new omens surrounding him, and begins to muse that perhaps it was Death that had been sending him premonitions all along. Just as he says this, a series of events cause a semi to crash through the front of the cafe, killing all three, leaving no survivors of the McKinley Speedway incident.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a571ea5d26d70cc06018aa3f47f69c7a36394e0","amp;dn":"Final+Destination+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a571ea5d26d70cc06018aa3f47f69c7a36394e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,87,30,165,210,109,112,204,6,1,138,163,244,127,105,199,163,99,148,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
