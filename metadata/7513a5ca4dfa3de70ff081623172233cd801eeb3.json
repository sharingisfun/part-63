Be prepared to see some amazing shots and learn some techniques for capturing winter activities in your neck of the woods. Includes a special bonus class.\n\n\nCourse Lessons:\nIntroduction (01:42) Tom Bol introduces you to the course and to David, a Copper Mountain employee, to go over the ski resort's facilities.\n \nGear Guide (08:49) The extreme temperature and wet snow of winter can take a toll on your gear. Plus, getting your gear up a mountain on a ski lift can be tricky. Tom gives you some great tips and goes over the gear he uses when shooting in the snow.\n \nConquering No Contrast (08:51) One of the toughest challenges of winter sports is the fact that snow acts as a giant white reflector in a giant white environment..\n \nAdding Flash (04:34) Tom adds some fill light with a soft box to get a more dramatic look to his portraits in the bright sunlight.\n \nGetting a Powder Shot (02:49) You only get one chance to get an action shot on a pristine powder surface before having to change the angle.\n \nWide Angle with Fill Flash (06:38) Tom freezes the action and catches the sun with a wide angle, Radio Poppers, high-speed sync and a fast shutter speed.\n \nAction Flash Freeze (09:30) It's great if your subject knows the terrain. Eddie (the snowboarder) shows Tom a little cliff with a great background - Perfect for action shots with a quick turnaround time.\n \nSuper Pipe Action (07:17) As the light changes and the snow begins to fall, Tom switches to one strobe and one chance per pass to catch the big air shot.\n \nAction Photo Sequence (05:56) Day 3 brings beautiful blue skies - Perfect for some fast action shots to make a photo sequence composite.\n \nComposing a Sunstar Shot (07:16) Tom uses high-speed sync to get a great shot that also catches the sun without ghosting the image.\n \nWoodward (00:56) Get a quick overview of the Woodward Training Facility - The world's first indoor ski and snowboard training camp at Copper Mountain.\n \nPOV Photography (04:41) Inside the Woodward Training Facility, Tom Bol goes over POV (Point of View) photography equipment and shows you some things you can do with it.\n \nBONUS: Post-Process Composite Shot (07:55) As a special bonus, Tom Bol shows you how he made the composites featured in Lesson 9.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7513a5ca4dfa3de70ff081623172233cd801eeb3","amp;dn":"Winter+Sports+Photography+By+Tom+Bol+%28Kelby+Training%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7513a5ca4dfa3de70ff081623172233cd801eeb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,19,165,202,77,250,61,231,15,240,129,98,49,114,35,60,216,1,238,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
