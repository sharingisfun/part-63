From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz, this film is an unusually intimate journey into the stubborn persistence of violence in our cities. Shot over the course of a year out of Kartemquin Films, The Interrupters captures a period in Chicago when it became a national symbol for the violence in our cities. During that period, the city was besieged by high-profile incidents, most notably the brutal beating of Derrion Albert, a Chicago High School student, whose death was caught on videotape. The filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s main subjects work for an innovative organization, CeaseFire, which believes that the spread of violence mimics the spread of infectious diseases, and so the treatment should be similar: go after the most infected, and stop the infection at its source.\n\nGenre: Documentary\nIMDB rating: 8.1/10 (349 votes)\nDirected by: Steve James\nStarring: Ameena Matthews, Jeff Fort, Cobe Williams\n\nRelease Name: The.Interrupters.2011.DVDRiP.XViD-TASTE\nSize: 1.4GB (2CD)\nAudio: English ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ AC3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 192 kbps\nVideo: XViD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 640ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€352 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1326 kbps\nRuntime: 2 hr. 5 min.    \n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa6667f337b5d7c02fc740d03bd2707247826dd","amp;dn":"The+Interrupters+2011+DVDRiP+XViD-TASTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fa6667f337b5d7c02fc740d03bd2707247826dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,166,102,127,51,123,93,124,2,252,116,13,3,189,39,7,36,120,38,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
