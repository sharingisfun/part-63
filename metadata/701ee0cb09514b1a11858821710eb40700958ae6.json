You'll also find (a bit of) non-fiction and historical fiction in the mix, but this torrent consists primarily, in descending order, of sci-fi, fantasy and horror. \n\nIt's a good mix; I doubt many of you will be disappointed. However, if there's anything you don't want when the torrent is finished downloading, scrap whatever you're not interested in.\n\nHere's the author list:\n\n[b]Adams, Richard\nAnderson, Poul\nBallard, J. G.\nBaum, L.

So I think quite a few of you will be pleased to find well-formatted copies of books you've been seeking out for a long time here (note: 99% of the books in this collection are well-formatted).\n\n[color=Red]If your E-reader doesn't have support for the EPUB format, downloadsame torrent in the MOBI format[/url].[/color]\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:701ee0cb09514b1a11858821710eb40700958ae6","amp;dn":"An+eBook+Collection+of+%28Mostly%29+Sci-Fi%2C+Fantasy+%26amp%3B+Horror+%28EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"701ee0cb09514b1a11858821710eb40700958ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,30,224,203,9,81,75,26,17,133,136,33,113,14,180,7,0,149,138,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
