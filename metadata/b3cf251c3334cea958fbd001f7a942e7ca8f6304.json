It is a moment in history that finally buries the        \n  infamous White Australia Policy and transforms a nation.              \n                                                                        \n  The years that follow are as dramatic as they are turbulent - a       \n  people struggling to find their place in a foreign land. In this one  \n  tiny Sydney suburb, the 80s and 90s see the arrival of street gangs,  \n  a heroin epidemic and the first political assassination in            \n  Australias history.                                                  \n                                                                        \n  The Vietnamese people are vilified and demonised. Cabramatta it       \n  seems represents all that is wrong with Asian immigration. Whats     \n  more the community exist against a political backdrop that is         \n  fractured, the universal support for multiculturalism a distant       \n  memory.                                                               \n                                                                        \n  But as the century draws to a close there is a remarkable             \n  turnaround. The Vietnamese people finally find their voice           \n  speaking up to claim their rightful, democratic place in their        \n  adopted home. Cabramatta is a community transformed. Australia, a     \n  continent changed forever.                                            \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sbs.com.au/shows/onceuponatimeincabramatta&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sbs.com.au/shows/onceuponatimeincabramatta&lt;/a&gt;                 \n                                                                        \n  More quality doco's from SBS!                                         \n                                                                        \n  See also: Immigration.Nation.Part1.HDTV.XviD-W4F                      \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;166122707564736156717b777f7a3875797b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3cf251c3334cea958fbd001f7a942e7ca8f6304","amp;dn":"Once.Upon.A.Time.In.Cabramatta.Part1.HDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3cf251c3334cea958fbd001f7a942e7ca8f6304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,207,37,28,51,52,206,169,88,251,208,1,247,169,66,231,202,143,99,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
