The author of the book The Animator's Survival\n  Kit, he is considered one of the greatest living animators.\n\n  He spent 24 years on his masterpiece The Thief and the Cobbler, which was never\n  completed as intended. This terrible Miramax version inserts song numbers, bad\n  voiceovers and generally spits all over Williams' intentions.\n\n  This is the only time this film, in any form, was released on DVD in widescreen.\n\n  Please watch The Thief and the Cobbler Recobbled Cut, which restores Williams'\n  original intention as seen in his workprint.\n\n  You can see all of Richard Williams' work on a certain Tube video site at\n  the channel thethiefarchive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:386bcd64221a6bd2f7d0d3c8706f7d5d54cd2362","amp;dn":"Arabian+Knight+%5BThe+Thief+and+the+Cobbler+Miramax+Edit%5D+WS+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"386bcd64221a6bd2f7d0d3c8706f7d5d54cd2362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,107,205,100,34,26,107,210,247,208,211,200,112,111,125,93,84,205,35,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
