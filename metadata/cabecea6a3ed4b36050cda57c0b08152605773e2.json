In Adios, America she touches the third rail in American politics, attacking the immigration issue head-on and flying in the face of La Raza, the Democrats, a media determined to cover up immigrants' crimes, churches that get paid by the government for their &quot;charity,&quot; and greedy Republican businessmen and campaign consultantsâ€”all of whom are profiting handsomely from mass immigration thatâ€™s tearing the country apart. Applying her trademark biting humor to the disaster that is U.S. immigration policy, Coulter proves that immigration is the most important issue facing America today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cabecea6a3ed4b36050cda57c0b08152605773e2","amp;dn":"Ann+Coulter+-+Adios%2C+America+-+The+Left%27s+Plan+to+Turn+Our+Count","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cabecea6a3ed4b36050cda57c0b08152605773e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,190,206,166,163,237,75,54,5,12,218,87,192,176,129,82,96,87,115,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
