The first build is not targeted at any specific audience, It's merely a base to branch off several other genre specific builds, for programmers, game enthusiast, artist, etc. From here, the long term goal is compatibility. To run anything, on anything, regardless of what OS and hardware the item was made for.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/adonislinux/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/adonislinux/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAdonis Linux Alpha 0.2.0 #Current release is installable, preferred to be installed within a VM.# #Use at your own risk, not responsible or liable for data loss# Added from 0.1.1: Wifi and wire connections should now work and be managed easily/automatically. Install via the icon on the desktop. Simply delete it when Installation is done. At this point, it's a fully setup and stable OS, though it's minimal in design. As such after the next major release(s) the project will begin to branch into multiple paths. Known bugs: trackpad movement is buggy  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/adonislinux/files/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/adonislinux/files/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adonislinux.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adonislinux.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha1sum : 4bdd20b45d5a20d47060677747fba69d4915792b  Adonis_Alpha_0-2-0.iso\nmd5sum : fc1b19aaad2f059c068748dec2dd3e7f  Adonis_Alpha_0-2-0.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c702c51c79bdbcce3d2b13b4dc0073872ae6d64a","amp;dn":"Adonis_Alpha_0-2-0.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c702c51c79bdbcce3d2b13b4dc0073872ae6d64a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,2,197,28,121,189,188,206,61,43,19,180,220,0,115,135,42,230,214,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
