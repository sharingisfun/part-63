The only way to get to     \n    it is by rigging a 500-metre zip wire way above the      \n    wave-lashed rocks.                                        \n                                                               \n    Incredibly, it seems that Gateholm Island in              \n    Pembrokeshire was once inhabited, but whether by Romans  \n    Vikings, Celts or druids nobody knows.                    \n                                                               \n    A handful of mysterious objects were found on the         \n    island years ago, including a rare Roman stone phallus   \n    and a beautiful bronze stag, suggesting that it may       \n    have been some sort of religious centre.                   \n                                                              \n    Of course, the team have to dig for answers, but the     \n    weather's throwing everything it has at them. To make     \n    their task that bit tougher, they discover they also       \n    need to dig at a second site a quarter of a mile away.    \n    Although this one, thankfully, is on the mainland.       \n                                                              \n    Team leader Francis Pryor thinks it looks like what        \n    they're investigating is a classic Iron Age fort, with    \n    curved banks and ditches on one side and a sheer cliff   \n    on the other.                                             \n                                                               \n    If he's right, it should give Phil Harding and his        \n    diggers at least enough work to keep them busy for       \n    three days. And if he's wrong, there's no hiding place    \n    on this beautiful but bleak coast!                         \n                                                              \n                                                               \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n     As per usual channel 4's numbering is a mess, they        \n     previously listed another episode as s19e01, that has    \n     now changed however, and this episode is now listed as  \n     episode 1                                                \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7cfd9fdffb7a6928332d47c21689c8a1218d3b3","amp;dn":"Time.Team.S19E01.REAL.READ.NFO.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7cfd9fdffb7a6928332d47c21689c8a1218d3b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,207,217,253,255,183,166,146,131,50,212,124,33,104,156,138,18,24,211,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
