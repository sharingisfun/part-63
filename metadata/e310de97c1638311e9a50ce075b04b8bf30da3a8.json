Breaking Dawn Part Two will be an explosive treatment of the vampiric Armageddon launched by the evil black-clad elders known as the Volturi, led by a grinning Michael Sheen. They figure briefly in Part One, the second time during the end credits as a curtain-raiser for next year's finale. Otherwise this part deals exclusively with matters matrimonial and obstetric as 18-year-old, small-town sheriff's daughter Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) from Washington State marries pale, ageless vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and surrenders her virginity on a honeymoon in Brazil. \n\nNOTES : RippeR brings to you another high quality release in small size. English Subtitles added.
