In the hands of this acclaimed storyteller, the past and future collideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the result is at once intriguing, elusive, and frightening.\n\nOxford in 2060 is a chaotic place. Scores of time-traveling historians are being sent into the past, to destinations including the American Civil War and the attack on the World Trade Center. Michael Davies is prepping to go to Pearl Harbor. Merope Ward is coping with a bunch of bratty 1940 evacuees and trying to talk her thesis adviser, Mr. Dunworthy, into letting her go to VE Day. Polly ChurchillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next assignment will be as a shopgirl in the middle of LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blitz. And seventeen-year-old Colin Templer, who has a major crush on Polly, is determined to go to the Crusades so that he can ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcatch upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to her in age.
