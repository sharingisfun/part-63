At just over 1,000 feet, the iron tower has stood on the Left Bank since 1889, and was the tallest building on the planet for 40 years. More than six million tourists visit this famous Parisian landmark annually. But how many have ever stopped to wonder how much its actually worth? \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \nWorst conversion I have ever seen NatGeo do.  1 clean frame and 5 blended frames loop the whole way.
