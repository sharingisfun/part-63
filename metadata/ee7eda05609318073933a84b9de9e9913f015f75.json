This release on Original Jazz Classics.\n\nReview Scott Yanow:\nThe third of three sets released by Pablo from Milt Jackson's engagement at Ronnie Scott's Club in London in 1982 (this CD first came out in 1991) lives up to its title. The great vibraphonist, pianist Monty Alexander, bassist Ray Brown and drummer Mickey Roker play two standards, the leader's &quot;Used to Be Jackson&quot; and six songs associated with Duke Ellington. The music swings hard, Alexander competes with Bags for solo honors and the music should please all straightahead jazz fans.\n\nMilt Jackson - Vibes\nMonty Alexander - Piano\nRay Brown - Bass\nMickey Roker - Drums\n\n01.
