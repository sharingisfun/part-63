Indeed it is, but not because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s set during the crusades. No, The First Templar is historical because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a look back at dated game design, a testament to how things were once done, and how they should never be again. This is the story of a Templar named Celian, a knight who is on a quest to recover the Holy Grail. His journey takes him all over the Middle East, with stops in historical cities like Acre. At its core, The First Templar is a hack-and-slash adventure, wherein youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be pushed through a series of environments, bludgeon tons of enemies and solve mind-numbingly easy puzzles. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen done better many times before.\n\nMoments into The First Templar you know youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re playing a budget game. The menus and user interface are bad with generic fonts and an intrusive heads up display. The screen is simply too crowded ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially in split-screen cooperative play ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and it takes away from any of the ambience or occasional beauty the environments have. Games like Dead Space have shown that UI can be both elegant and serve a purpose, while The First TemplarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s is just phoned in","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b25f4bee550eca34db7c960b2abf4859a759b348","amp;dn":"The+First+Templar+-+Blackbox+Pc+Game+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b25f4bee550eca34db7c960b2abf4859a759b348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,95,75,238,85,14,202,52,219,124,150,11,42,191,72,89,167,89,179,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
