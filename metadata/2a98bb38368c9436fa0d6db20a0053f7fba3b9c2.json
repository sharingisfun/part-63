Clef and company lay it down live at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City, working out songs that would eventually become &quot;The Preacher's Son&quot; album.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. Next Generation\n2. I Am Your Doctor\n3. Class Reunion (Aziria)\n4. Three Nights In Rio\n5. Baby Daddy\n6. Shottas\n7. Freestyle Jam\n\nThis highly interactive DVD, directed by Jim Swaffield, brings you up close and personal with the artists. Here is a description from an Apple Final Cut Pro interview with Swaffield:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy idea was to make a DVD that would let fans engage and interact with the artist in a new way,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVibe SessionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ creates this up-close feeling by offering viewers choices and blending navigation and functionality throughout the program. Wyclef Jean addresses his fans directly, talking them through the DVDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s special features and encouraging them to participate in the experience he and his band are creating.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVibe SessionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ complements the CD with top-quality digital audio, recording session and location shots and lots of banter between the musicians. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBetween songs, you can click out to the menu and play around with it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Swaffield. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn one pass youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll hear Clef talking about the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meaning, and in another youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see the band working out the chords.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In addition to three or four variations of each song, the DVD stays fresh by playing the tracks in a unique order each time through.\nWyclef Jean is enthusiastic about how well ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVibe SessionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ keeps the spirit of his music alive. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen we jam, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all about the vibe,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Jean. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe wanted to capture the vibe of one of our live sessions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and really bring the fans into that experience. The DVD turned out to be the perfect way to do this, both in the real, up-close way it was shot, and in the way the programming makes it come to life as you experience it.\nRead the full article here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/swaffield/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/swaffield/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRipped byÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦illReput3\n\nAudio only (FLAC &amp; LAME 320kbps) &amp; .mp4 DVDRip torrents also available.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a98bb38368c9436fa0d6db20a0053f7fba3b9c2","amp;dn":"Wyclef+Jean-+Preacher%5C%27s+Son%3A+Vibe+Session+DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a98bb38368c9436fa0d6db20a0053f7fba3b9c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,152,187,56,54,140,148,54,250,13,109,178,10,0,83,247,251,163,185,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
