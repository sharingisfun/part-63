All does not go as planned and he is soon entangled in a web of deceit.\n\nElmo McElroy is a streetwise American master chemist who heads to England to sell his special new formula - a powerful, blue concoction guaranteed to take you to 'the 51st state.' McElroy's new product delivers a feeling 51 times more powerful than any thrill, any pleasure, any high in history. But his plans for a quick, profitable score go comically awry when he gets stuck in Liverpool with an unlikely escort and his ex-girlfriend and becomes entangled in a bizarre web of double-dealing and double-crosses.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227984/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227984/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade8bbec47f7daee4e31168f987c854010077a2d","amp;dn":"The+51st+State+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade8bbec47f7daee4e31168f987c854010077a2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,232,187,236,71,247,218,238,78,49,22,143,152,124,133,64,16,7,122,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
