Using WindowsNT driver\ntechnology, Snapshot brings two new features to disk\nimaging:\n\n1. Snapshot Backup - create disk images while\nWindows is running. This allows the user to work in\nhis usual environment when backing up his data. Any\ndevice suitable for file storage can be used for the\nimage destination, like your local drive, a network\ndrive or any removable drive. And - most important -\nthe image will be an industrial quality image, even\nthough WinNT constantly writes to the disk. The user\nmay continue to work normally, while a backup\noperation is in progress; the image will still be\nvalid and consistent. This enables one of the most\nimportant things in backup business: backup often.\nIt is even possible to make an image backup for\nservers, that must be online 24 hours a day.\n\nSnapshot Backup - Main use. Snapshot Backup is aimed\nat the backup/disaster recovery market. There is\nlittle use for on the fly disk image creation, if\nyou want to deploy hundreds or thousands of\nworkstations. We think however, that the possibility\nto do on the fly backup is very important for the\nend user to regularly protect his data. At least,\nthis was our reason to create Snapshot. No need to\nshut down and boot from floppy, no need to create\nnetwork disks, and no need to wait half an hour for\nthe backup process - we think that's nice.\n\n2. Snapshot View - Explore saved disk images the\nfriendly way. The image file is presented to the\nuser as a virtual drive. This virtual drive can be\nused like any other drive, using any Windows\nprogram, be it Explorer, Norton Commander, or your\nfavourite MP3 Player.\n\nSnapshot View - Main use. Snapshot View is a very\neasy and powerful method to explore disk images.\nThis technique could be easily adapted to disk\nimages created by other disk imaging programs.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* Create Disk Image Backups, While Running Windows.\nThe Backup process will back up all your data into\na single file, containing all data, including\nsystem data and registry, for total security,\nshould your computer ever crash. There is no\nrestart (to DOS) necessary. Ever.\n\n* Continue your work, while the Backup is in\nprogress. The new Snapshot technology ensures that\nall data are consistent, and reflect the PC's data\nat the start of backup. There are no difficulties\nwith opened files. Ever. This enables a very fast\nand easy way to back up servers and other\ncomputers, that must run 24 hours a day.\n\n* Easy Use and Restore of single Files or\ndirectories. Drive Snapshot creates a virtual\ndrive, containing all your drive's data. You may\nuse, compare, or restore these files directly from\nthe Disk Image file. This works with any program\nof your choice, including (of course) the Windows\nExplorer.\n\n* Complete Restore of a disk in case of Disaster. If\na disk is restored to its original state, it will\nbe exactly the same as at the time of Backup -\nbyte for byte. Restoring a system partition will\nrequire DOS; other drives can be restored using\nWindows.\n\n* Compatible with all Windows file systems (FAT16,\nFAT32, NTFS). Supports Linux EXT2/3/4/Reiser.\n\n* Compatible with all Windows RAID Methods.\n\n* Very easy and comprehensive command line\ninterface. This makes automation of regular tasks\na breeze.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nDo NOT distribute this release outside of the scene\nKeep the scene alive and secure!\n\nAll good progs start as freeware,\nthen things get worse ... ;-)\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\n`TLB'\nTry it, Like it, Buy it!\n\n1. Unpack and install.\n2. Copy the included file to the installed folder.\n\nThat's all... Enjoy! ;-)\n\nAlways remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling\nhome 'during install'. Once installed, disable 'check for automatic\nupdates' option if available, so that you don't get it blacklisted.\n\nEAT  CONTACT\n\nEAT is a closed group.
