Thompson. Tiring of the noise and madness of New York and the crushing conventions of late Eisenhower-era America, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) travels to the pristine island of Puerto Rico to write for a local newspaper, run by downtrodden editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). Adopting the rum-soaked life of the island, Paul soon becomes obsessed with Chenault (Amber Heard), the wildly attractive Connecticut-born fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e of Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart). Sanderson is one of a growing number of American entrepreneurs who are determined to convert Puerto Rico into a capitalist paradise in service of the wealthy. When Kemp is recruited by Sanderson to write favorably about his latest unsavory scheme, the journalist is presented with a choice: to use his words for the corrupt businessmenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s financial benefit, or use them to take the bastards down.\n\nGenre: Comedy | Drama | Romance\nIMDB rating: 6.7/10\nDirected by: Bruce Robinson\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Giovanni Ribisi and Aaron Eckhart\n\nRelease Name: The.Rum.Diary.2011.DVDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-SiC\nSize: 1.77 GB\nQuality: 720ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€384 | 1 640 Kbps | 23.976 fps | AC3 448 Kbps\nRuntime:120 min\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a6c0eb565b0ced4495dd06ec68e098164585f67","amp;dn":"The.Rum.Diary.2011%2CDVDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-SiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a6c0eb565b0ced4495dd06ec68e098164585f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,108,14,181,101,176,206,212,73,93,208,110,198,142,9,129,100,88,95,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
