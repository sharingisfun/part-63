Nomadic shepherds, plagued by drought, happen on a fishing encampment with plentiful fresh water. The local men are away but will return when it rains; the shepherds stay to refresh their flock until the rain comes. A shepherd lad and a local girl, both on the verge of puberty, start a mating dance. Also, one of the shepherds approaches a beautiful local woman, inviting her to sleep with him. How will she respond? She's married, her husband at sea for the week. Is love forever or temporary? A subtext dramatizes the capture of fish, birds, foxes, and other animals: their fates seem arbitrary. \n\n-imdb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47355c8b82f50676b5cda9688cdea226237a5a5d","amp;dn":"Mikres+Afrodites+%281963%29+-+Nikos+Koundouros","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47355c8b82f50676b5cda9688cdea226237a5a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,53,92,139,130,245,6,118,181,205,169,104,140,222,162,38,35,122,90,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
