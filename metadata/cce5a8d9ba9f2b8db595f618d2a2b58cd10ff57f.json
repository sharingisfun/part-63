Total Uninstall accurate analyzes installed programs to \nuninstall them completely.\n\nMy Personal Opinion: I have tried almost all uninstallers out there and I can\nhonestly say.. this is the best.. especially if you're into making Portable\nApplications or you like to keep your computer clean of trash... which is very\nhard with installations. Most software manufacturers do a shitty job with their\nuninstallers. All they care about is that you install their product. The worst\nuninstaller i have ever used is 'Your Uninstaller! Pro'. Stay away from that\ncrap. All it does is uninstall, lol. It doesn't use snapshots. It's a rip off.\n\nHow to Install           : Execute, launch 'TotalUninstallPortable.exe'.\n\nNotes                    : Unlike other versions that claim to work but do not\nwhen you block the Internet, this really works! \n\nActivation               : \n1. Install to 'PortableApp' directory or your designated directory.\n2. Launch 'TotalUninstallPortable.exe'.\n3. Disconnect Internet or Block 'Tu.exe' &amp; 'TuAgent.exe' with Firewall.\n4. Register with provided Name &amp; Serial.\n5. Complete.. this is a 1-time activation.\n\nCrack Warning            :\nI am using ESET Smart Security 5 and if i have 'Potentially Unsafe Apps.'\nchecked.. i get a warning. It's completely safe. I personally use this. With\nmost 'cracks' / 'keygens', Anti-Viruses will falsely identify as 'Malware'.\n* If you are unsure.. just don't use it :)\n\nUpgrading from Older Version?\nIf you're using an old version.. all you do is install this and import all of\nyour saved snapshots via 'Import': http://www.martau.com/tu_bk_compat.php\n\nProfessional vs. Standard: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.martau.com/total-uninstall-professional-vs-standard.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.martau.com/total-uninstall-professional-vs-standard.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cce5a8d9ba9f2b8db595f618d2a2b58cd10ff57f","amp;dn":"Total+Uninstall+5.10.1+Portable+%28PAF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cce5a8d9ba9f2b8db595f618d2a2b58cd10ff57f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,229,168,217,186,159,43,141,181,149,246,24,210,162,181,140,209,15,245,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
