The adventures throughout the trip will be interesting, but risky. The sheep will need a wise assistant!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.wildtangent.com/runningsheeptinyworlds/game_info_feature.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.wildtangent.com/runningsheeptinyworlds/game_info_feature.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe game is an uncomplicated brainteaser consisting of small labyrinths which are filled with various obstacles. The most dangerous ones are wolves and pits: Coming across them will cause the player to lose sheep. The player's objective is to safely lead the sheep under his care through the labyrinths. To do this, he has to lay out arrows on the field which the sheep will step on to go in the right direction. Guide the sheep along safe pathways to their homes, where they will be saved! The number of arrows is limited, so to make them last for the entire trip, you have to erase the used arrows and lay them out again.\n\nRunning Sheep: Tiny Worlds is an engrossing brainteaser with simple controls, vivid graphics, and 250 levels. It's wonderful entertainment for the whole family!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.runningsheep.com/tinyworlds/source/image/rs-tw1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.runningsheep.com/tinyworlds/source/image/rs-tw1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.runningsheep.com/tinyworlds/source/image/rs-tw2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.runningsheep.com/tinyworlds/source/image/rs-tw2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.runningsheep.com/tinyworlds/source/image/rs-tw3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.runningsheep.com/tinyworlds/source/image/rs-tw3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.runningsheep.com/tinyworlds/source/image/rs-tw4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.runningsheep.com/tinyworlds/source/image/rs-tw4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeatures\n\n250 levels.\nUncomplicated brainteasers\nVivid graphics\nSimple controls\nA game for the whole family\nA prequel to the game Running Sheep\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/Win7\nCPU: 1.0 GHz\nRAM: 256 MB\nDirectX: 7.0\nHard Drive: 20 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b577cc6d4cde0dd31f2e7e9b3fc04d8836a4eb6","amp;dn":"Running+Sheep+Tiny+Worlds+-+Full+PreCracked+-+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b577cc6d4cde0dd31f2e7e9b3fc04d8836a4eb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,87,124,198,212,205,224,221,49,242,231,233,179,252,4,216,131,106,78,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
