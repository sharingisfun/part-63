If you don't, please do your research on pyffi'ing Oblivion (and other game) meshes to optimize game speed\n\nUploading this because i couldn't find it anywhere else on the net and i noticed a lot of people on the Oblivion forums were asking for it but because of legal reasons everyone was too shit scared to upload it. well fuck that\n\nIt's the vanilla non-GOTY Oblivion Meshes.bsa file which has already been optimized to save you the 10 hours it would normally take (on a multi-core cpu)\n\n\n\nIf you don't know what this is, it's an optimized version of the main polygon models (think characters, buildings, objects, weapons) in Oblivion and should gain everyone a few FPS over the vanilla unoptimized version\n\nI only had to do this because Bethesda are fucking lazy shits and couldn't do their own optimization, though I forgive them because they make otherwise fucking amazing games\n\n\n\nbefore you ask, i don't think it will work on GOTY, so someone else can learn pyffi and do GOTY and upload it here\n\nInstall instructions:\n\n1. unzip into the Oblivion\\Data folder\n2. play Oblivion like a boss","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0723373f6ba421f3efefac3a04d0125b361194ec","amp;dn":"Oblivion+Pyffi%5C%27ed+%28Optimized%29+Vanilla+Meshes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0723373f6ba421f3efefac3a04d0125b361194ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,35,55,63,107,164,33,243,239,239,172,58,4,208,18,91,54,17,148,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
