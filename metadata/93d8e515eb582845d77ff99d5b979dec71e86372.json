Thus begins his life as a quiet, straight-A student by day and a self-appointed hero at night. But what is a real hero? And who decides what is right or wrong? As the boundaries blur, SeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dual life wears on his psyche and his two worlds careen dangerously close to colliding. Like a graphic novel you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t put down, Boy Wonder challenges morality, distorting perceptions of what is right and what is justified, as it races to its shocking conclusion.\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Drama | Thriller\nIMDB rating: 6.7/10\nDirected by: Michael Morrissey\nStarring: Zulay Henao, James Russo and Tracy Middendorf\nRelease Name: Boy.Wonder.2010.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT\nSize: 700 MiB\nVideo: XviD | 640 x 272 | 850 kbps | 23.976 fps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 138 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 36mn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93d8e515eb582845d77ff99d5b979dec71e86372","amp;dn":"Boy.Wonder.2010.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93d8e515eb582845d77ff99d5b979dec71e86372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,216,229,21,235,88,40,69,215,127,249,157,91,151,157,236,113,232,99,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
