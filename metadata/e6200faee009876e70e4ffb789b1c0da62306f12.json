His poetry tells the story of a life beset with love, loss, and the political conflict that characterised the end of the Roman Republic.\r\n\r\nâ€˜Catullus' Bedspreadâ€™ follows the young poet's journey through a world filled with all the indulgences and sexual mores of the time, and his lasting affair with a married woman called Clodia. While Catullus and Clodia made love in the shadows, the whole of Italy was quaking as Caesar, Pompey and Crassus forged a doomed allegiance for power.
