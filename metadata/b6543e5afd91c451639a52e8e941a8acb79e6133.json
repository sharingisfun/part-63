An edgy and somewhat depressing film about a cab driver coping with an endless stream of strange passengers, Page Hamilton compiles an eclectic array of alternative artists and scores the main theme. The Grifters' &quot;Radio City Suicide,&quot; Brad's &quot;Secret Girl,&quot; and Hamilton's own &quot;Score&quot; are strong selections driving this enduring moody mix. Although the majority of the material has been previously released, this collection is further bolstered by rarities from Pearl Jam (&quot;Hard to Imagine&quot;), Supergrass (&quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot;), and Fu Manchu (&quot;Swami's Last Command&quot;). Whereas many soundtracks can sound hackneyed, this interesting collection stands on its own away from a checkered movie that saw little success at the box office and confusion at video stores due to the name change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€“Sparklehorse \tHammering The Cramps \t2:48\r\n\r\nâ€“Supergrass \tDon't Be Cruel \t5:09\r\n\r\nâ€“The Grifters* \tRadio City Suicide \t5:49\r\n\r\nâ€“Joey Altruda And His Cocktail Crew \tCha Cha #69 \t3:59\r\n\r\nâ€“Pearl Jam \tWho You Are \t3:50\r\n\r\nâ€“Hi Fi Killers \tPomona \t2:59\r\n\r\nâ€“Fu Manchu \tSwami's Last Command \t3:16\r\n\r\nâ€“Brad \tSecret Girl \t3:15\r\n\r\nâ€“Pearl Jam \tHard To Imagine \t4:34\r\n\r\nâ€“Page Hamilton \tScore \t2:17\r\n\r\nâ€“Hovercraft \tHaloparidol \t4:20","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6543e5afd91c451639a52e8e941a8acb79e6133","amp;dn":"Music+From+Chicago+Cab+%281998%29+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6543e5afd91c451639a52e8e941a8acb79e6133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,84,62,90,253,145,196,81,99,154,82,232,233,65,168,172,183,158,97,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
