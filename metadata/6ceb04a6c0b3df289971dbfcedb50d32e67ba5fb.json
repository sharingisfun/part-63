Also cleaned the audio up in adobe using a hiss removal filter aswell as changing the EQ bands.\n\nThe video i cleaned the russian video up,changed the res ....yes it looks really thin now,but due to movement in the original russian files\nthe AR does change slightly throughout,so i opted to pic a res i thought looked best. Also changed all the brightness,contrast,rgb eq,chroma,sharpness you name it :lol: . From there i took the youtube clip ,levelled it up and filtered that aswell and appended to my encode.\n\nReadnfo ...well basically just to say yes the runtime is different to unknowns but i removed all the black screen with credit music as i didn't\nsee the point,but each to their own ....but now this encode as no video overlap and full intro and the end scene after the credits .\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ceb04a6c0b3df289971dbfcedb50d32e67ba5fb","amp;dn":"The+Grey+2012+TS+READNFO+XViD+-+INSPiRAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ceb04a6c0b3df289971dbfcedb50d32e67ba5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,235,4,166,192,179,223,40,153,113,219,252,237,181,13,50,230,123,165,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
