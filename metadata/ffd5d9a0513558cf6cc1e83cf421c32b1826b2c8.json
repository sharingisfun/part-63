After Sheridan re-shot some scenes because they did not go down well with test audiences, Morgan Creek took away the film from Sheridan's hands to re-cut it themselves. As a result, they created the trailer which many felt gave away too many of the movie's secrets. As a result, Sheridan, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz refused to promote the film to the press.\n\nDuring the shooting of this film, actors Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz fell in love and started a relationship, which was publicly announced months later. The actress later married Craig in a discreet ceremony. When asked about the movie, Craig said &quot;The movie didn't turn out great. But I met my wife. Fair trade&quot;. \n\nNot screened in advance for critics. \n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/bUg8l.png[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/kBU0v.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/txr1O.png[/IMG]\n\nDream House 2011 720p BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nZdCe.png[/IMG]\n\n\n[FORMAT]:             [ Matroska\n[AWARDS]:             [ NONE\n\n[GENRE]:              [ Drama | Mystery | Thriller\n[FILE SIZE]:          [ 573 MiB\n[NO OF CDs]:          [ 1\n[RESOLUTION]:         [ 1280*542\n[ASPECT RATIO]:       [ 2.35:1\n[FRAME RATE]:         [ 23.976 fps\n[LANGUAGE ]:          [ English\n[SUBTITLES]           [ muxed\n[ORIGINAL RUNTIME]:   [ 01:30:00\n[RELEASE RUNTIME]:    [ 01:30:00\n[SOURCE]:             [ wiki\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\nthanks to the awesome scorp(the best ripper)\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jHcjQ.png[/IMG]\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UzVN6.png[/IMG]\n\nPLOT: Soon after moving into their seemingly idyllic new home, a family learns of a brutal crime committed against former residents of the dwelling.\nDirector: Jim Sheridan\nStars:            Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts\nimdb: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462041/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462041/&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/HMvmh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/HMvmh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/RqXLJ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/RqXLJ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/PwrTd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/PwrTd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/rCbgF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/rCbgF.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n                                        TO VISIT MY facebook page to post requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR \n\n\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffd5d9a0513558cf6cc1e83cf421c32b1826b2c8","amp;dn":"Dream+House+2011+720p+BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffd5d9a0513558cf6cc1e83cf421c32b1826b2c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,213,217,160,81,53,88,207,108,193,232,60,244,33,195,43,24,38,178,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
