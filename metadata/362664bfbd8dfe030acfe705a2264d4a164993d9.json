Use at own risk!\n\n\n* Nobody is perfect and android neither.\n* Apps you have already deleted, sometimes leave data behind.\n* The system constantly creates logs, crash reports and debug files you don't really need.\n* The market leaves temporary files of downloaded apps behind.\n* Lets not go on here...\n\n- Why not get a maid to clean it all up? SD maid will help you keep your device neat, clean and tidy for you :)!\n\n- Choose a tab, press check and then either click a single item to delete or press the clean all button. It's just that easy.\n\n- The explorer is a full fledged filemanager, use it to crawl through your androids files.\n\n- You can use the searcher to open/delete or rename files (wildcards are supported as is searching inside files).\n\n- The corpse finder searches your device for dormant directories and compares those to the list of installed applications.\n\n- The system cleaner scans the devices known directories with unnecessary files.\n\n= The Optimize DBs tab checks databases (System/Apps) and allows you to shrink bloated databases to speed up access and free space.\n\n= The Misc tab features various cleaning options. A bit of a playground for me to implement user requests.\n\n= 9 features are currently available in the free version and an additional 2 can be unlocked by buying and installing the unlocker.\n\n= SD Maid is constantly being developed and is designed very carefully.\n\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\nv0.9.7.5\n\n- temporary hotfix for bug in android 2.2\n\nv0.9.7.4\n\n- @Common:\n* Improved various coded parts\n* Improvements for ICS\n* New busybox to fix issues on galaxy nexus\n* @Explorer\n* Fixed FC on opening directories\n* Removed the object size of directories\n* @Systemcleaner:\n* Fixed an issue on HTC EVO 4G\n- @Duplicate finder:\n* After deletion of duplicates the remaining file will be hidden\n* Sets will now be recolored\n* Fixed summary\n* Selections are cleared on deletion\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/214/001ptx.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/214/001ptx.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/252/002oj.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/252/002oj.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/341/003kbu.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/341/003kbu.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/833/004psn.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/833/004psn.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/36/005zpo.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/36/005zpo.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/403/006dol.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/403/006dol.jpg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/690/007slf.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/690/007slf.jpg/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy and Please Seed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:362664bfbd8dfe030acfe705a2264d4a164993d9","amp;dn":"SD+Maid+Pro+Full+v0.9.7.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"362664bfbd8dfe030acfe705a2264d4a164993d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,38,100,191,189,141,254,3,10,207,231,5,162,38,77,74,22,73,147,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
