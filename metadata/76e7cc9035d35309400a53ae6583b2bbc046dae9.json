The first of these, a self titled \nalbum found here is now a super rare psychedelic album that sells for very \nhigh prices on the collectors market.\n\nThe original master tapes are long lost and the resulting CD re-issue (now \nlong deleted) was copied from the best surviving vinyl that could be found.\n\nTherefore donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect pure digital sound. The original was recorded on the \ncheap, pressed on the cheap, and poorly packaged in a sleeve that was too \nsmall! (meaning most original LPs were stored by buyers simply in dusty \ninner sleeves)\n\nSo, on the minus side, the sound quality leaves a little to be desired. But on \nthe plus side, the music is wonderful sounding very similar to best of the \nBritish pop-sike scene of 1967.\n\nIf you are a fan of bands like Kaleidoscope, Wimple Winch, Tomorrow, \nearly Floyd, etc you will find much to enjoy here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e7cc9035d35309400a53ae6583b2bbc046dae9","amp;dn":"Complex+debut+1970+Psych+gem+from+UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76e7cc9035d35309400a53ae6583b2bbc046dae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,231,204,144,53,211,83,9,64,10,83,174,101,131,178,187,192,70,218,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
