This release 1990 on Polygram.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nGuitarist Herb Ellis still considers this to be one of his personal favorite recordings. Ellis was reunited with his old boss Oscar Peterson and, with the assistance of Peterson's trio of the period (with bassist Sam Jones and drummer Bobby Durham), the two lead voices often romp on the jam session-flavored set. Most of the chord changes are fairly basic (including three blues and &quot;Seven Come Eleven&quot;), and Peterson was clearly inspired by Ellis' presence (and vice versa).\n\n01. Naptown Blues    \n02. Exactly Like You  \n03. Day By Day  \n04. Hamp's Blues    \n05. Blues for H. G.  \n06. A Lovely Way To Spend An Evening    \n07. Seven Come Eleven\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a46161899179704eb782e5fbee56eb140058fcc5","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+Trio+%26amp%3B+Herb+Ellis+-+Hello+Herbie+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a46161899179704eb782e5fbee56eb140058fcc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,97,97,137,145,121,112,78,183,130,229,251,238,86,235,20,0,88,252,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
