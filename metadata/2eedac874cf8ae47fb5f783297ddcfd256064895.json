Create amazing images from challenging high-contrast scenes. New HDR Merge lets you combine multiple photos taken with different exposure settings into a single high dynamic range image.\r\n\r\nWhat's New in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC:\r\nHDR images made easy\r\nCreate natural-looking or surreal images from extremely high-contrast scenes. Using HDR Merge, you can easily combine multiple shots taken with different exposure settings into a single high dynamic range image.\r\n\r\nStunning panoramas\r\nCapture superwide fields of view and amazing detail. Photomerge technology lets you stitch together multiple images, including raw files, to create seamless panoramas.\r\n\r\nFaster performance\r\nImport and perfect your photos faster than ever. Lightroom takes advantage of compatible graphics processors to boost its overall speed, especially when youÃ¢Â€â„¢re enhancing images in the Develop module.\r\n\r\nFacial recognition\r\nQuickly find images of family and friends, even without metadata tags. Select a face in one photo, and Lightroom searches for that person in all your other images. Categorize and group your photos based on faces.\r\n\r\nAdvanced video slide shows\r\nCreate beautiful, polished slide shows using still images, video and music along with professional effects like pan and zoom.\r\n\r\nImproved web galleries\r\nShowcase your work in more elegant, engaging and interactive web galleries. New HTML5-compatible gallery templates work with the widest range of desktop and mobile browsers.\r\n\r\nBetter control of filters\r\nPrecisely control which parts of your image are affected by the Graduated or Radial filters.

Get feedback on your photos, start discussions and more â€” all from Lightroom on your mobile device or desktop.\r\n\r\nSupport for more devices\r\nLightroom is now on Android devices.
