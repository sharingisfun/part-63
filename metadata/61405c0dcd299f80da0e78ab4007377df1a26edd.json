Shamed by his physical appearance and feared by all, the love he holds for his beautiful protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Christine DaaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is so strong that even her heart cannot resist.\n\nIn celebration of 25 glorious years, The Phantom of the Opera marked the occasion with 3 sell-out performances at the Royal Albert Hall. This lavish, fully staged production of Phantom of the Opera at the Albert Hall stars Ramin Karimloo as The Phantom and Sierra Boggess as Christine. They are joined by Barry James as Monsieur Firmin, Gareth Snook as Monsieur AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Liz Robertson as Madame Giry and Wynne Evans as Piangi together with a cast and orchestra of over 200 and some special guest appearances. Complete show with special finale.\n\nGeneral\nComplete name          : The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall-M@.avi\nFormat                 : AVI\nFile size              : 2.52 GiB\nDuration               : 2h 39mn            \n\nVideo\nFormat                 : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID               : XVID\nBit rate               : 1602 Kbps\nWidth                  : 640 pixels\nHeight                 : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio   : 16:9\nFrame rate             : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                 : AC-3\nBit rate mode          : Constant\nBit rate               : 640 Kbps\nChannel(s)             : 6 channels\nChannel positions      : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate          : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage               : English\n\nIMDb : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2077886/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61405c0dcd299f80da0e78ab4007377df1a26edd","amp;dn":"The+Phantom+of+the+Opera+at+the+Royal+Albert+Hall+BRRip+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61405c0dcd299f80da0e78ab4007377df1a26edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,64,92,13,205,41,159,128,218,14,120,171,64,7,55,125,241,162,110,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
