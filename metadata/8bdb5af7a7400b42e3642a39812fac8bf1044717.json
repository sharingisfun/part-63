Perfect for attempts to predict the FOREX market using natural language processing.\nHave a go at it, and post messages here if you wish!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bdb5af7a7400b42e3642a39812fac8bf1044717","amp;dn":"2011+news+archive+august-december","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bdb5af7a7400b42e3642a39812fac8bf1044717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,219,90,247,167,64,11,66,227,100,42,57,129,47,172,139,241,4,71,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
