Although Air Alert\nII has become a favorite around the world, we have worked to improve it. The Air Alert\nIII upgrade is the improved Air Alert. We changed the number of sets and reps, and, most\nimportantly, we changed the number of days per week that the program will be\ncompleted which will help with overall muscle recovery and strength development. We\nalso added one new exercise, Squat HopsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ to greatly benefit your vertical. Any topic\nthat you see on the Air Alert III upgrade MUST BE READ and followed as written.\nWhen you see a word &quot;CHANGE&quot; beside of a heading, this means that a change has been\nmade from Air Alert II to Air Alert III.\n\nPages: 8\nSize: 250 KB\nFormat: PDF\n\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abdd2e9aabb90bf5ccf09fcea9414f46802565c5","amp;dn":"Air+Alert+3+Ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abdd2e9aabb90bf5ccf09fcea9414f46802565c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,221,46,154,171,185,11,245,204,240,159,206,169,65,79,70,128,37,101,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
