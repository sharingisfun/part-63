To complicate matters the second    \n  channel was in a different format (HD, 1080i). Funnily enough it      \n  looks like it broke their ad system, last 40 mins had zero ad breaks! \n                                                                        \n  Its quite shameful though, that in Australia we cannot normally       \n  enjoy cricket in HD, and even then when they do use their HD channel  \n  for sport it looks crap due to abysmal bitrate.
