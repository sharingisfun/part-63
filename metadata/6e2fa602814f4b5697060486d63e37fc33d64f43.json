Kal Penn, who plays Kumar, actually works at the White House and took time off from that job to make this movie. \n\nTodd calls Harold &quot;Sulu&quot; at one point. John Cho, who plays Harold, also played Sulu in the 2009 version of Star Trek. \n\nDavid Burtka, who plays &quot;David Burtka&quot; is Neil Patrick Harris's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in their real lives. In the same way that the character that Neil Patrick Harris plays is distinguished in the credits from being himself, Burtka is credited as &quot;David Burtka&quot; instead of &quot;himself.&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nA Very Harold and Kumar Christmas (2011) Extended Cut 720p_sujaidr\n\n\n\nvideo details\n\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b4fcddd3dcf4f8809a85&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 4 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 36mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 886 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 532 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.40:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.054\n\n\n\n\naudio details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 1h 36mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\n\n\nlanguage                         english\n\nsubs                             na\n\n\n\nSAMPLE                  :included\n\n\n\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nPLOT:Six years have elapsed since Guantanemo Bay, leaving Harold and Kumar estranged from one another with very different families, friends and lives. But when Kumar arrives on Harold's doorstep during the holiday season with a mysterious package in hand, he inadvertently burns down Harold's father-in-law's beloved Christmas tree. To fix the problem, Harold and Kumar embark on a mission through New York City to find the perfect Christmas tree, once again stumbling into trouble at every single turn.\n\n\nDirector: Todd Strauss-Schulson\n\nStars:         Kal Penn, John Cho and Neil Patrick Harris\nimdb:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1268799/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1268799/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/6LK7K.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/6LK7K.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/EYJvk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/EYJvk.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/TqrN7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/TqrN7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/D6q1C.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/D6q1C.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nTORRENT STAts\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/0486/7c96314.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/0486/7c96314.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e2fa602814f4b5697060486d63e37fc33d64f43","amp;dn":"A+Very+Harold+and+Kumar+Christmas+%282011%29+Extended+Cut+720p_sujai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e2fa602814f4b5697060486d63e37fc33d64f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,47,166,2,129,79,75,86,151,6,4,134,214,62,55,252,51,214,79,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
