The game is still a fast-paced first-person shooter, but instead of battling demons with series protagonist Daniel Garner, gamers take on the role of Belial, a half-angel, half-demon dealing with the repercussions of Garner's defeat of Lucifer. Players can equip themselves with eight new demonic weapons, and blast their way through 17 new levels filled with dozens of beatly monsters. Giant bosses face gamers at the end of every stage, but a new Tarot deck offers new powers and attack combinations to give Belial a fighting chance.\n\nOne App-3 Games\nPainkiller overdose V75.4\nPainkiller Resurection V44\nPainkiller Redemption V1.02A\n\nCider Port\nWorking on Lion 10.7.2\nCPU: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor\nRAM: 1024MB\nVideo: nVidia  8xxx or 9xxx Series or ATI / AMD , 4xxx or 5xxx Series Video Card\n\nCompatibility with Intel GMA Series Video Cards has not been tested. \n(most likely unsupported)\n\nWorking on ATI 4870 Perfektly\n\nMultiplayer no tested","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d3e906905858dd85cea4aa8ddf8d11a380cd2f5","amp;dn":"Painkiller+3in1+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d3e906905858dd85cea4aa8ddf8d11a380cd2f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,62,144,105,5,133,141,216,92,234,74,168,221,248,209,26,56,12,210,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
