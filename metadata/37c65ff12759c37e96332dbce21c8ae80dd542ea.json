They decide to age one of the photos and discover that is of Nathan as a child. He contacts the person who placed the photo to find out what's going on. The person on the other end only wants to know info about Nathan so Nathan hangs up. The person then contacts someone in Europe and shows him a photo of the one who called. He then heads for the U.S. Nathan then wonders is it true, was he abducted. He tells his &quot;mom&quot; who then tells him she and his &quot;father&quot; will tell him. But before they can, two men claiming to be cops show up wanting to talk to Nathan, and when he isn't found they pull guns and demand Nathan be given to them. His parents fight them but are killed. Nathan runs but remembers that he asked Karen to come over...\n\nDirector: John Singleton\n\nStars:       Taylor Lautner, Lily Collins and Alfred Molina\nimdb:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1600195/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1600195/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/8Fm0O.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/8Fm0O.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/PKeey.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/PKeey.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/WFLwD.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/WFLwD.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/VzVVR.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/VzVVR.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c65ff12759c37e96332dbce21c8ae80dd542ea","amp;dn":"Abduction+2011+720p+BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c65ff12759c37e96332dbce21c8ae80dd542ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,198,95,241,39,89,195,126,150,51,45,188,226,28,138,232,13,213,66,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
