Kronos' search leads him to the Durward estate where he is met by the effete children of the apparently aged and sick Lady Durward.\n\n\n\nReview:Captain Kronos:Vampire Hunter is a very unusual entry in the Hammer CanonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. Director/Scriptwriter Brian Clemens film is full of interesting and original ideas which he brings to screen with an assured confidence. The Hooded figure that lurks in the leafy glades and stalks the local wenches is done very well and the identity is never given away until the end.The shadow of a crucifix that comes to life in a church is also a high point. The film is also quite funny with some very good witty dialogue that helps the film move along at a fair old pace. Kronos is a also not scarce on action and contains a good few Excellent action set pieces. Captain Kronos:Vampire Hunter was initially planned to be Hammer's next big franchise but sadly poor box office put an end to that which is a huge shame as it is truly a classic of 70s Horror and a film that all Hammer enthusiasts should see.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eb1035beb4f83ba83bd186e3d9a26285a4697ff","amp;dn":"Capitan+Kronos+-+Vampire+Hunter+%7BHammer%7D+%5B1974%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eb1035beb4f83ba83bd186e3d9a26285a4697ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,177,3,91,235,79,131,186,131,189,24,110,61,154,38,40,90,70,151,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
