Al-Husseini was a bridge figure in terms of transporting the Nazi genocide in Europe into the post-war Middle East. \n\nAs the leader of Arab Palestine during the British Mandate period, al-Husseini introduced violence against moderate Arabs as well as against Jews. Al-Husseini met with Adolf Eichmann in Palestine in 1937 and subsequently went on the Nazi payroll as a Nazi agent.\n\nAl-Husseini played a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in instigating a pro-Nazi coup in Iraq in 1941, in urging Nazi's and pro-Nazi governments in Europe to transport Jews to death camps, in training pro-Nazi Bosnian brigades, and in funneling Nazi loot into post-war Arab countries.\n\nAuthor: Chuck Morse\nPublisher: WND Books\nPublication Date: August 10, 2010\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b75e4666b3d597da40f300f123001cff5b5c32","amp;dn":"Chuck+Morse+-+The+Nazi+Connection+to+Islamic+Terrorism+%28mobi%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b75e4666b3d597da40f300f123001cff5b5c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,183,94,70,102,179,213,151,218,64,243,0,241,35,0,28,255,91,92,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
