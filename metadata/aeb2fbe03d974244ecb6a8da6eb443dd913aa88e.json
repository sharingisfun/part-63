Players will tear through desert, urban and industrial settings in their experimental battle engine, the Abrams M1A6 Advanced tank that is loaded with awe-inspiring devastating weapons and armored to near indestructibility. You are the commander of a top secret M1A6 experimental tank division in the Armor Task Force. Your mission was to lead the northern front of Operation Desert Thunder, a secret military operation to overthrow a terrorist faction that has taken control of a peaceful Middle Eastern country. Your mission has been compromised, your small battalion devastated. Left with no alternative, you must complete your mission to reach the capital city and rendezvous with allied forces. \n\n                Compressed with 7zip, scanned with Comodo IS\n\n             Extract &amp; Play, Xpadder + Xbox 360 Profile included\n\n                              Output size 506mb, \n         \n                           Please seed at least 1:1\n\n                                     ENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb2fbe03d974244ecb6a8da6eb443dd913aa88e","amp;dn":"Desert+Thunder+%2B+Xpadder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb2fbe03d974244ecb6a8da6eb443dd913aa88e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,178,251,224,61,151,66,68,236,182,168,218,110,180,67,221,145,58,168,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
