Tom Chandler learns that the destroyer will be in the best possible place -- a circumstance his crew must utilize -- to save humanity from extinction. A virus has wiped out more than half the population since the ship embarked, and despite orders from the U.S. government to return, Chandler -- believing home is now a shadow of itself -- decides the safest place to develop a vaccine is at sea. That task falls mainly to virologist Dr. Rachel Scott, a civilian originally assigned to the Nathan James to study birds. &quot;The Last Ship&quot; is based on a novel by William Brinkley and is executive-produced by filmmaker Michael Bay (&quot;Transformers&quot;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:495dfd37011ed2d08667aec47ef6d96fda52b008","amp;dn":"The+Last+Ship+-+Complete+Season+1%2C+2and+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"495dfd37011ed2d08667aec47ef6d96fda52b008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,93,253,55,1,30,210,208,134,103,174,196,126,246,217,111,218,82,176,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
