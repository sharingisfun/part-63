So vast it is visible from space, the reef is actually built by tiny animals in partnership with microscopic plants. It is a place full of surprises, always changing, responding to the rhythms of weather, tide, sun and moon. \n\nWithin this magical and intensely crowded world this episode reveals how the amazing reef creatures compete and co-operate - from deadly fish-hunting snails to sharks that can walk on land, fighting corals and parrot fish that spin sleeping bags every night. \n\nRemote cameras, cutting edge underwater macro and digital time-lapse photography, have captured many sequences which have never been filmed before, providing completely fresh perspectives on this extraordinary natural wonder.\n\n\n\nGreat Barrier Reef - S01 - E01 - Nature's Miracle\nGreat Barrier Reef - S01 - E02 - Reef To Rainforest\nGreat Barrier Reef - S01 - E03 - Reef And Beyond\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 59mn 2s\nBit rate                                 : 1 531 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 608 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\n\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 59mn 2s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 114 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b958c114e0192e7e9760b74603e5599c49de928","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Great+Barrier+Reef+-+Series+01+-+TvRip+-+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b958c114e0192e7e9760b74603e5599c49de928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,149,140,17,78,1,146,231,233,118,11,116,96,62,85,153,196,157,233,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
