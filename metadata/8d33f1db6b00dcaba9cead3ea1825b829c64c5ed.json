It also follows his family, known as the Endless .\r\n\r\nThe concept of The Sandman emerged from Neil Gaimanâ€™s idea to revive Jack Kirbyâ€™s 1970â€™s Sandman series after his Black Orchid mini series at DC Editor Karen Berger suggested he keep the Sandman name but create the rest of the series entirely from scratch. Using ideas he had of a character that lived in dreams, Gaiman created the character of Morpheus, a literal take on the folklore concept of the Sandman and a personification of dreaming itself. With this, Gaiman revived several dormant DC horror and mystery characters and populated his world of The Dreaming with them. The series soon evolved beyond its DC Universe horror origins and became one of the most critically acclaimed fantasy comic series of all time, regularly outselling its superhero counterparts toward its end and introducing comics to whole new audiences outside of the comics mainstream. The collected editions have been reprinted numerous times and remain best sellers for DC/Vertigo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d33f1db6b00dcaba9cead3ea1825b829c64c5ed","amp;dn":"The+Sandman+%28v01+-+v10%29+%282010+-+2011%29+%28Neil+Gaiman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d33f1db6b00dcaba9cead3ea1825b829c64c5ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,51,241,219,107,0,220,171,169,206,173,62,161,130,91,130,156,100,197,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
