In his 2012 linux.conf.au talk, XFS developer Dave Chinner served notice that he thinks more users should be considering XFS. His talk covered work that has been done to resolve the biggest scalability problems in XFS and where he thinks things will go in the future. If he has his way, we will see a lot more XFS around in the coming years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da299ed922768a46bd293c0fda9c8def9ec90c48","amp;dn":"%5BDave+Chinner%5D+XFS%3A+Future+Adventures+In+Filesystem+Scalability+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da299ed922768a46bd293c0fda9c8def9ec90c48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,41,158,217,34,118,138,70,189,41,60,15,218,156,141,239,158,201,12,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
