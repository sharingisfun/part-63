Instead of doing that work yourself, let Moom handle the task for you.\n\nUse the Mouse\n\nMove your mouse over the green zoom button in any window, and Moom's mouse control overlay will appear (as seen in the above animation). Here's what happens when you click the various icons in Moom's mouse control overlay:\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Full Screen\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Left Half\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Right Half\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Top Half\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Bottom Half\n\n* Revert to Original Dimensions\n\n\nThe Grid\n\nMoom's mouse controls optionally include a grid that lets you resize and move windows by dragging your mouse across its segments:\nYou can configure the number of segments (width and height) in the grid in Moom's Settings.\n\nQuarterly Results\n\nDragging the half width/height icons a few pixelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½instead of clickingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½transforms them, giving you even more options for arranging windows:\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Top Left Quarter\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Top Right Quarter\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Bottom Right Quarter\n\n* Move &amp; Zoom to Bottom Left Quarter\n\nQuarters available via dragging depend upon which icons you drag. For instance, the left half icon lets you zoom to the top left corner by dragging up, and zoom to the bottom left corner by dragging down.\n\nMultiple Displays\n\nDrag those icons even further towards another display, and you'll see a little arrow pop up, such as this one:\n\n\nProvided there's a display there, you can combine any zoom icon with any dragging direction to zoom and move to another display at the same time.\n\nUse the Keyboard\n\nKeyboard mode allows you to do everything you can do in mouse mode, and more. Here are the functions you can assign to various keyboard shortcuts:\nIn addition to zooming windows to full/half/quarter-screen sizes, you can move them (while optionally confining them to the display), send them to another display; and center them.\n\nSimply define a trigger hot key that activates Moom's keyboard control overlay:\nWhile the overlay is visible, you can use easy-to-remember keys (e.g., the arrow keys) to control the frontmost window, instead of having to memorize tons of outlandish key combos.\n\nTo keep things as simple as possible, some features are controlled via sequences of keyboard inputs. For instance, to zoom a window to the top left quarter of the screen, you'd press Command-Up Arrow then Command-Left Arrow in rapid succession.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac OS X.6 or better\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec0a836bd1ea306d354f04b185af0b615d711fcd","amp;dn":"Moom+v.+2.3.3+with+SK+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec0a836bd1ea306d354f04b185af0b615d711fcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,10,131,107,209,234,48,109,53,79,4,177,133,175,11,97,93,113,31,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
