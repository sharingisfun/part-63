It is largely compatible with other major office suites, including Microsoft Office, and available on a variety of platforms. LibreOffice has no licensing fees, is available in a large number of local languages and gives users the opportunity to participate in its development.[4]\nLibreOffice is a hybrid word, meaning &quot;Free Office&quot;. Libre means free (as in freedom) in French and Spanish.\nLibreOffice has been downloaded approximately 7.5 million times since its first stable launch in January 2011.[5] It is the default office suite in many Linux distributions, such as Fedora,[6] Linux Mint,[7] openSUSE,[8] and Ubuntu.[9]\nLibreOffice can be run on Microsoft Windows 2000 (with Service Pack 4 or newer) or newer, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger or newer, and Linux-based systems running Linux kernel version 2.6.18 or newer.[1] Ports for FreeBSD and OpenBSD are being maintained by contributors to those projects, respectively.[10][11][12]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef2e8863ec07065025eb0e9207e5121768a9cbee","amp;dn":"LibreOffice+3.5+RC+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef2e8863ec07065025eb0e9207e5121768a9cbee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,46,136,99,236,7,6,80,37,235,14,146,7,229,18,23,104,169,203,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
