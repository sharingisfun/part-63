He lives alone, drowning his nightmares with alcohol. Christine - smart and successful... on the surface, tackles life as a single working mother by immersing herself in drugs, parties and sex. Lynette, a young rough sleeper watches Christine stumble out of a club whilst she sits in the cold waiting for loose change to fall on her lap; her luck seems to change when she meets Frank who despite his misgivings, offers her a place to stay.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdf4258d5a37e675f78b48d63635103423050de9","amp;dn":"Junkhearts+2011+DVDRIP+XVID-WBZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdf4258d5a37e675f78b48d63635103423050de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,244,37,141,90,55,230,117,247,139,72,214,54,53,16,52,35,5,13,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
