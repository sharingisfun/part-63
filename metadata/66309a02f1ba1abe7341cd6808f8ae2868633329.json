The contaminated area becomes uninhabitable for a decade, when Lucifer-Alpha mutates into a non-lethal form. This tragic event later becomes known as &quot;the Catastrophe&quot;.\n \nFifty years later, a breed of artificial life-forms or bioroids known as &quot;snatchers&quot; began appearing in the artificial island of Neo Kobe City, killing their victims and taking their place in society. Nobody knows exactly what they are or where they come from. As Gillian Seed, an amnesiac working for an Anti-Snatcher task force called J.U.N.K.E.R., the player's goal is to track down the source of the snatchers and discover Gillian's mysterious connections with them.\n\nBurnt with Nero and tested on my Mega CD-i also have the US version but iam unable to test as my Mega CD is PAL-So if anyone wants to test the US ver,post here and i'll upload asap.\n\nBiOhAzArD...EnJoY...\n\nUnited we stand-Divided we fall ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66309a02f1ba1abe7341cd6808f8ae2868633329","amp;dn":"Snatcher-Europe+Mega+CD+Rom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66309a02f1ba1abe7341cd6808f8ae2868633329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,48,154,2,241,186,26,190,115,65,205,104,8,248,174,40,104,99,51,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
