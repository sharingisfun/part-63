I lived for a time in Shetland and in Norway. I preferred both those places.\nBut I was born here, and I guess that I will die here !!\n \nSome of the English in EE sounds very &quot;Londonish&quot;, but I don't believe that people there really say things like &quot;sling yer hook&quot; and &quot; let's have a knees up&quot;. That's language from the fifties !!\n \nDebra is a nice name, but it does't sound very Polish. Is it short for something ?\nThere was a Debbie that was a very large part of my youth, Debbie Harry. \nEvery schoolboy's fantasy !!\n \nI think that I missed my chance with Jorunn, many years ago.\nBut we are still very close, and I can still dream !!\n \nYou should download the new series &quot;Call the midwife&quot;. It is very good.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDivx 1000/160 kbps\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7e131f1d13111b3e0a1f12150a1f121550101b0a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9de2313b0c5dcb89fdafeb5383b81ede2f94919","amp;dn":"EE+Eastenders+24-01+Tirsdag.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9de2313b0c5dcb89fdafeb5383b81ede2f94919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,222,35,19,176,197,220,184,159,218,254,181,56,59,129,237,226,249,73,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
