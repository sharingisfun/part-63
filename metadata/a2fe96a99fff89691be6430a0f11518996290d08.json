With its 16 well-chosen songs, largely culled from Williams's most rewarding material since the 1980s, Live is indispensable for longtime fans and a great introduction to her unique artistry for the uninitiated. Williams's deceptively plain-spoken, sometimes conversational lyrics about losses and passages and elusive touchstones of happiness are marvels of instant resonance, transcending minimalist imagery and fragmentary refrains. Surrounded by a small, guitar army and sometimes hypnotic rhythm section, Williams fills out &quot;Metal Firecracker&quot; with a vintage folk-rock sound, raises the extraordinary &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; and &quot;Greenville&quot; to new heights, and delivers--with a voice as lovely as a bell--a stirring performance on &quot;Sweet Old World.&quot; Lest we forget her appreciation of the Doors, &quot;Joy&quot; brings the show to a head with its gritty, shamanic blues and evocative promises (&quot;I'm gonna go to West Memphis and find my joy&quot;) that make one want to jump with excitement for 74 minutes in 5.1 Surrounding Sound.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pineola\n2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Metal Firecracker\n3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Car Wheels On A Gravel Road\n4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Right In Time\n5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drunken Angel\n6 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Greenville\n7 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lake Charles\n8 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Changed The Locks\n9 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Joy\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Disgusted\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jackson\n12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sweet Old World\n13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Passionate Kisses\n14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Something About What Happens When We Talk\n15 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Still I long For Your Kiss\n16 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Let Go","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2fe96a99fff89691be6430a0f11518996290d08","amp;dn":"Lucinda+Williams+-+Live+From+Austin+Texas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2fe96a99fff89691be6430a0f11518996290d08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,254,150,169,159,255,137,105,27,230,67,10,15,17,81,137,150,41,13,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
