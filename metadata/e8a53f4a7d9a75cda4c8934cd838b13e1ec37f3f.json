All of these are of very high quality, and were painstakingly proofread. All books are available in 4 formats: .docx, .pdf, .epub and .pdf. You can read them on your e-reader of choice, print, or read them on the PC.\n\nI hope you all enjoy the works of this terrific author. I intend to publish a 2nd torrent later this year (very late, in all likelihood), containing all remaining Stephen King books.\n\nEnjoy, and please help me seeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a53f4a7d9a75cda4c8934cd838b13e1ec37f3f","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+ebooks+-+The+First+20+years","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a53f4a7d9a75cda4c8934cd838b13e1ec37f3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,165,63,74,125,154,117,205,164,200,147,76,216,56,177,62,30,195,127,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
