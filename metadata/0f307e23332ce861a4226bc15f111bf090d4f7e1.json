It also allows users to decide which channels will be excluded from the final caches.\n\nRendering\n- mental ray for 3ds Max renderer support ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ available for both Windows and Linux.\n- The Preview Window gives users almost instant feedback on render settings.\n- Fast self-shadowing is produced through an Illumination Map which is integrated inside of the FumeFX object.\n- A highly efficient Multiple Scattering model enhances light dispersion throughout fluid.\n- Fluid Mapping integrates procedural map details with fluid motion.\n- The dynamic FusionWorks atmospheric renderer provides:\n- Render Elements: Fire, Smoke, Velocity\n- Proper blending with AfterBurn and ScatterVL Pro.\n- Balanced mixing of FumeFX and compatible atmospherics with 3ds Max Fog\n- Ability to apply Image Motion Blur\n- Option to affect Effect Channel\n- Z depth\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n1. Disable/close any running firewall(s)\n\n2. Install Fume, run as admin if required, simply let it open normally in sandbox if you are using avast.\n\n3. Go to folder C:\\Program Files (x86)\\AFLICS\\ (It's there even if you installed Fume somewhere else)\n\n4. Run AfterFLICS_tools.exe as ADMINISTRATOR and go to Service --&gt; Stop (Keep the program open)\n\n5. Replace the AfterFLICS.exe (from crack folder) in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\AFLICS\\\n\n6. Back in AfterFLICS program, go to Service --&gt; Restart (you may now close the program)\n\n7. Run 3ds Max 2012 as ADMINISTRATOR, you can find Fume under command panel &gt; Create &gt; Geametry drop down list\n\n8. Click on FumeFx button and AfterFlics will pop up with activation window, minimise max at this point\n\n9. Back in windows Run 'cmd' (press windows + R in keyboard), type 'ipconfig/all' note the Host Name: (should be the name of your PC)\n\n10. Go back to Max and in the activation window type the noted Host Name from previous step and press 'Add Server'\n\n11. With new server selected (not the localhost) press Authenticate, new window will pop up\n\n12. Select Manual Activation radio button and enter anything you wish.\n\n13. When Fume runs for the first time, you may face flicker issues, without changing any setting in Fume Save the Max file, close the application and Run max as usual. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f307e23332ce861a4226bc15f111bf090d4f7e1","amp;dn":"FumeFx+2.1C+for+3ds+Max+2012+x64%2Fx32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f307e23332ce861a4226bc15f111bf090d4f7e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,48,126,35,51,44,232,97,164,34,107,193,95,17,27,240,144,212,247,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
