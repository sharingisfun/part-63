The &quot;Notepad Sorter&quot; window lets you view, rearrange, or weed pages easily.\n\nFor security, any page can be rendered unreadable when the program is in the background, has been inactive for a period of time, or whenever the &quot;lock&quot; is clicked. You may also choose to require a password to unlock pages.\n\nA seamlessly integrated calculator will solve a mathematical expression typed into any page. Also, any word or phrase can be made into a hyperlink.\n\nPages are searchable by title or content, and an unobtrusive pull-down menu on each notepad allows for quick navigation. Pages can also be hidden, or set to float above all other applications.\n\nEmail the content of any page, whether text or media, (as an attachment or plain text) using Apple Mail, Eudora, or Entourage.\n\nTo ease the transition from Stickies or SpiralBound, SpiralBound Pro can import your data automatically. Also features automatic updates and check-for-updates.\n\nWhat's New\n\n* Release notes were unavailable when this listing was updated.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.5. or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:652b248d901770634d66e3898459976f41a75fea","amp;dn":"Spiralbound+Pro+v.+2.0.2+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"652b248d901770634d66e3898459976f41a75fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,43,36,141,144,23,112,99,77,102,227,137,132,89,151,111,65,167,95,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
