This spikes them coming up with a scheme. That is to dress up as women to get jobs as pharmaceutical reps. Their plan works initially and find out what women really want in the process and become better men because of it. &quot;Work It&quot; is a comedy that looks into the lives of two men who have had enough and want to try something new. All at the same time of hiding it from people they know.\n\nCreated by Andrew Reich and Ted Cohen (Romantically Challanged), the comedy brings out the truth of women in the work place and in a &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; type of style, Lee and Angel pull off being women while trying to not blow their cover in the process. Joining them are office employees Grace (Rebecca Mader), Vanessa (Rochelle Aytes), Kelly (Kate Reinders), Kristin (Kirstin Eggers)and Kat (Kacie Lynch) as they hang out with Lee and Angel thinking all the time that they are women just like them.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb84a18ec779be891302e20b44fe35e2cb89f064","amp;dn":"Work.It.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-ASAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb84a18ec779be891302e20b44fe35e2cb89f064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,132,161,142,199,121,190,137,19,2,226,11,68,254,53,226,203,137,240,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
