Diamond. It is based on the 1929 Hungarian one-act play Egy, kettÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶, hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rom by Ferenc MolnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r, with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;plot borrowed partly from\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Ninotchka, a 1939 film co-written by Wilder.[2][3] The comedy features James Cagney, Horst Buchholz, Pamela Tiffin, Arlene Francis, Leon Askin, Howard St. John, and others.[4] It would be Cagney\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s last film appearance until Ragtime, 20 years later.[5][6]\nThe film is primarily set in West Berlin during the Cold War, but before the construction of the Berlin Wall, and politics is predominant in the premise.\nC.R. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Mac\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; MacNamara is a high-ranking executive in the Coca-Cola Company, assigned to West Berlin after a business fiasco a few years earlier in the Middle East (about which he is still bitter). Nevertheless, Mac is angling to become head of Western European Coca-Cola Operations, based in London. After working on an arrangement to introduce Coke into the Soviet Union, Mac receives a call from his boss, W.P. Hazeltine in Atlanta. Scarlett Hazeltine, the boss\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hot-blooded 17-year-old socialite daughter, is coming to Berlin and Mac receives the unenviable task of taking care of this young whirlwind.\n\nCast\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJames Cagney as C.R. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Mac\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; MacNamara\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tHorst Buchholz as Otto Ludwig Piffl\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tPamela Tiffin as Scarlett Hazeltine\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tArlene Francis as Phyllis MacNamara\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tLiselotte Pulver as FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ulein Ingeborg (Mac\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s secretary)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tHoward St. John as Wendell P.
