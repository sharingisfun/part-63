She enlists the aid of some highly intelligent, escaped lab rats that have built a subterranean society inside a rose bush near the farmer's garden. The rats, led by the wise Nicodemus, decide to help her physically move her house to repay a debt of gratitude to her late husband, who made possible the rats' escape from the laboratory. But things become complicated when some of the rats decide to use the situation to kill Nicodemus and make it appear to be accidental.\n\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nPlease do not hit and run...seed so others may enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0611a2ec8e240c80eb54c56f80f6954975ff59ee","amp;dn":"Secret+of+NIMH+%281982%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0611a2ec8e240c80eb54c56f80f6954975ff59ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,17,162,236,142,36,12,128,235,84,197,111,128,246,149,73,117,255,89,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
