Maybe your battery is draining a little too quickly? Ever want to catch at a glance what's causing all of these issues?\n\nAll of this may be because one program is using an excess amount of resources in your computer.\n\nWe all have many apps open, most of which are inactive, but how do you figure out what programs are causing you to lag or drop from your nice 7 hours of battery all the way down to 2?\n\nSystem Lifeguard is here to let you know exactly which programs are affecting your system, and by how much.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo know , learn and get all things come and join here\nLOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT THINGS ARE HERE\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents                                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1350+ torrents                                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the \\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it\\'s users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt\\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It\\'s an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That\\'s for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet\\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\\'s said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the \\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167e7da8100320b3f82060f39e8ddd763c47c474","amp;dn":"SystemLifeguard.v1.0.MacOSX.Retail-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167e7da8100320b3f82060f39e8ddd763c47c474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,126,125,168,16,3,32,179,248,32,96,243,158,141,221,118,60,71,196,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
